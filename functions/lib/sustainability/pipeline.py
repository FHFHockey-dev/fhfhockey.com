"""Combined pre-scoring pipeline helper.

Assembles the sustainability data flow up to (but not including) score
aggregation & logistic mapping (Tasks 4.1â€“4.3 integrated + z-score prep 4.2).

Steps:
  1. Load configuration (or accept injected cfg).
  2. Load SD constants (fixed or empirical placeholder).
  3. Compute or accept injected league priors.
  4. Compute or accept injected player priors for target season.
  5. Build rolling windows for all players (GAME, G5, G10, STD) with freshness.
  6. Annotate windows with z-scores vs posterior expectations.
  7. Annotate reliability factors r_<metric>.

Returns list of enriched window rows ready for soft clipping / contribution
weighting & final scoring (next tasks 4.4+).
