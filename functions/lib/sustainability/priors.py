"""League-level Beta prior computation utilities (Task 3.1).

Computes Beta prior parameters (alpha0, beta0) for luck / variance-heavy rate metrics
broken out by position. These priors are used to shrink player-level binomial rates.

Current modeled metrics (binomial style):
  - sh_pct       (player goals / player shots)
  - oish_pct     (on-ice goals for / on-ice shots for)
  - ipp          (player points / on-ice goals for)

Potential extension (toggle later):
  - oisv_pct (on-ice saves / on-ice shots against) â€” treated similarly but may be excluded
    for skater-focused modeling initially.

Design Notes:
  * We derive league_mu = successes / trials (with guard for trials=0).
  * Prior strength k (pseudo sample size) is sourced from configuration k_r[metric].
    This reuses reliability constant so that shrinkage aggressiveness and reliability
    curve are harmonized (simplifies initial calibration). Can be decoupled later.
  * alpha0 = league_mu * k, beta0 = (1 - league_mu) * k.
  * If trials == 0, we fall back to a neutral Beta(1,1) (uniform) and league_mu = 0.0.
  * Output records: {season_id, position_code, stat_code, alpha0, beta0, k, league_mu}.

Integration:
  Upstream must supply aggregated league counts per (season, position, metric).
  Provide a fetch function stub `fetch_league_aggregates` for DB integration.
