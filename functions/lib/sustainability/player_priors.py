"""Player multi-season posterior blending (Tasks 3.4â€“3.7).

Responsibilities:
  * Fetch per-player per-season successes/trials for regression-prone metrics.
  * Apply multi-season weights (default target: 0.6, prev1: 0.3, prev2: 0.1) with re-normalization if seasons missing.
  * Compute blended successes & trials and Beta posterior means using league priors.
  * Flag rookies (no prior season data) for downstream usage.
  * Provide upsert stub for `player_priors_cache` (ON CONFLICT update semantics).

Metrics handled mirror league priors: sh_pct, oish_pct, ipp.

Data Model (expected from fetch function): rows shaped like:
  {
    'player_id': int,
    'season_id': int,
    'position_code': 'F'|'D',
    'sh_pct_successes': int, 'sh_pct_trials': int,
    'oish_pct_successes': int, 'oish_pct_trials': int,
    'ipp_successes': int, 'ipp_trials': int,
  }

League priors mapping input shape:
  {(season_id, position_code, stat_code): LeaguePriorRow}

Outputs for upsert:
  player_id, season_id (target), position_code, stat_code,
  successes_blend, trials_blend, post_mean, rookie_status, model_version
