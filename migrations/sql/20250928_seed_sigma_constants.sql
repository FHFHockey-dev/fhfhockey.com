-- Migration: Seed fixed standard deviation constants for initial 'fixed' Ïƒ mode

-- NOTE: Values are placeholder baseline approximations; replace with empirically derived preseason / historical sample values.

-- Helper: upsert function (optional). Using INSERT ... ON CONFLICT is sufficient if supported.

-- Metric codes seeded: sh_pct, oish_pct, oisv_pct, ipp, ixg_per60, icf_per60, hdcf_per60
-- Position codes: C, LW, RW, D
-- Placeholder logic: skill/process metrics typically have higher variance in small samples; shooting% narrower.
