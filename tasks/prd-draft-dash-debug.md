### Performance & Data Pipeline Optimization Roadmap (NEW)

Context: Projection source tables are static per season; indices exist on player_id and primary keys. Goal is to reduce initial draft dashboard load time and interactive re-computation latency without changing public types or exported APIs.
### Success Metrics

Initial projections load TTFP (time to fantasy points displayed) reduced by >=30% vs baseline.
### Validation Strategy

1. Instrument baseline timings (fetch, process, render) before changes; store in `console.table` snapshot (dev only).
### Notes / Constraints

Must not alter exported types: `ProcessedPlayer`, `TableDataRow`, hook return signatures.
## Performance Update Log (append as changes land)

2025-09-15: Added debounced persistence + last non-zero weight restore in `useProjectionSourceAnalysis` (Tier 1: Debounced sourceControls save). 
2025-09-15: Introduced stale run guard scaffolding (runIdRef) and FP-only recompute placeholder + startTransition in `useProcessedProjectionsData` (Tier 1: Stale run guard). 

2025-09-15: Added composite base / FP keys for future FP-only fast path (Tier 1: Hash/composite key groundwork). 
2025-09-15: Implemented phase instrumentation logs + improved pagination helper (head count, spread push, timing) in `useProcessedProjectionsData` (Tier 1 & Hang Issue mitigation start).
2025-09-15: Added async processing scaffolding with stale run abort checks before/after round summaries (no partial commits) in `useProcessedProjectionsData`.

2025-09-15: Inlined async per-player processing loop with periodic yielding (every 200 players) and mid-loop stale abort.

### Newly Identified Issues (UI/Data Regressions)

Issue A: Duplicate Compare Checkbox Column
- Symptom: After moving the compare checkbox to the far right (COMP.), an earlier left-side compare checkbox remained, producing two selectable columns.
- Root Cause: Initial refactor added the new column without removing the original compare input cell & header placeholder.
- Status: Left duplicate column removed; only rightmost COMP. column retained (ProjectionsTable.tsx / ProjectionsTable.module.scss).
- Follow-up: Ensure accessibility labeling for single remaining checkbox; confirm no stale CSS selectors remain.

Issue B: Value Band Colors (Proj FP / VBD) Lost Visual Emphasis
- Symptom: Green / Yellow / Red bands faded or overridden by zebra striping.
- Root Cause: Zebra row backgrounds had higher specificity; value band classes lacked stronger background overlay.
- Fix: Added reinforced `.valueBand.valueSuccess|Warning|Danger` styles with higher z-index and explicit backgrounds.
- Follow-up: Re-test in dark and light theme modes (if applicable) and ensure contrast ratios >= WCAG AA.

Issue C: Missing ADP (average_draft_pick) Values
- Symptom: ADP column shows '-' for all players; previously populated from `yahoo_players.average_draft_pick`.
 Symptom: ADP column showed '-' for all players; previously populated from `yahoo_players.average_draft_pick`.
 Confirmed Root Cause (post‑investigation): Lookup mismatch caused by relying only on one identifier form. Some mappings referenced composite Yahoo `player_key` values (e.g. `465.p.12345`) while the original fetch queried only by numeric `player_id` (tail segment). As a result, many current‑season rows (scoped by `game_id=465`) were never retrieved or not addressable via the key actually used in `yahooPlayersMap` during processing.
 Implemented Fix: Dual query strategy added:
  1. Split requested IDs into composite IDs (containing '.') and raw numeric IDs.
  2. Query `yahoo_players` twice (by `player_key` and by `player_id`) each constrained with `game_id=465`.
  3. De‑duplicate preferring rows whose `player_key` begins with `CURRENT_YAHOO_GAME_PREFIX`.
  4. Populate `yahooPlayersMap` under BOTH `player_id` and `player_key` to allow flexible resolution when only one form is present in mapping.
 Instrumentation: Dev‑only console.debug block logs counts (compositeIds, numericIds, fetched rows, dedup size, final map size) plus a 3‑entry sample including ADP values for verification.
 Remaining Risks / Edge Cases:
  - Mapping table might store an outdated season prefix causing lookups to resolve to stale / absent ADP (should be mitigated by dual keys).
  - Players with null ADP legitimately (undrafted / new entrants) must not be treated as failures.
  - Potential performance overhead of two queries (acceptable now; can merge with OR logic later if needed, but current Supabase pagination helper simplicity preferred).
 Validation Plan (current phase):
  - Count processed players with non-null parsed ADP; expect > 0 for mainstream skaters.
  - Spot check a few known early‑round players vs Yahoo site values (within reasonable rounding tolerance).
  - Ensure ADP sort ascending places elite players (e.g., McDavid) near top when no other sort applied.
  - Verify `SuggestedPicks` risk model now computes availability (was previously skipping due to null ADP).
 Cleanup (post‑validation):
  - Gate verbose ADP debug logs behind a future `DEBUG_PROJECTIONS` or remove entirely.
  - Collapse dual query if schema guarantees both identifiers moving forward (defer for now).
 Definition of Done (ADP slice): Non‑zero count of players with `processedPlayer.yahooAvgPick !== null`; ADP visible & sortable; risk / suggestion calculations consuming numeric ADP; no TypeScript regressions.

Issue D: Control Toggle Button Focus Styling
- Symptom: Control buttons (.controlToggleBtn) did not visually align with new compare emphasis; requested focus-color border and 40% opaque background when active/focused.
- Fix: Added `.controlToggleBtnActive, .controlToggleBtn:focus-visible` styling using `$focus-color` with translucent background.
- Follow-up: Apply `.controlToggleBtnActive` class in JSX where an active state is conceptually applied (pending if not already wired) and test keyboard focus ring.

Issue E: Compare Button Visual Affinity (Pending)
- Symptom: Compare launch button not yet styled with new yellow/focus-color scheme.
- Planned: Apply `.compareLaunchButton` class to the toolbar Compare button when `selectedIds.size >= 2` for visual affordance.

# PRD: Draft Dashboard Debug & UX Fixes

Owner: Tim  •  Status: Draft  •  Scope: Draft Dashboard (web/pages/draft-dashboard.tsx)

## Goals
- Fix category management for Categories leagues (include goalie metrics).
- Keep Team VORP and Proj Pts fixed as rightmost columns on the Draft Board.
- Prevent SHP from appearing unless explicitly added in Points leagues.
- Make Keepers autocomplete selection stick on first click.
- Correct goalie stat label/mapping for GA vs GAA.
- Resolve Suggested Picks hanging when filtering by Skater.

## Non‑Goals
- Redesign of Draft Dashboard UI or data model.
- Changes to projections math or VORP algorithms beyond label/mapping fixes.

## Affected Files
- Entry: `web/pages/draft-dashboard.tsx:1`
- Settings UI: `web/components/DraftDashboard/DraftSettings.tsx:1`
- Draft Board: `web/components/DraftDashboard/DraftBoard.tsx:1`
- Suggested Picks: `web/components/DraftDashboard/SuggestedPicks.tsx:1`
- Player Autocomplete: `web/components/PlayerAutocomplete/PlayerAutocomplete.tsx:1`
- FP defaults: `web/lib/projectionsConfig/fantasyPointsConfig.ts:1`
- Stats mapping context: `web/hooks/useProcessedProjectionsData.tsx:223`

---

## Issue 1: Categories “Select Category” missing goalie metrics

Symptoms
- In Draft Settings, when `League Type = Categories`, the inline “Select Category” dropdown only lists skater metrics; goalie metrics are missing.

Likely Root Cause
- The addable list is built from skater keys only.
- Location: `web/components/DraftDashboard/DraftSettings.tsx:835` (`addableCategoryStats` uses `availableSkaterStatKeys` only).

Proposed Fix
- Merge skater and goalie keys when building `addableCategoryStats` in Categories mode:
  - `const allKeys = [...availableSkaterStatKeys, ...availableGoalieStatKeys]` and filter out existing selections.
- Ensure label helper returns correct goalie labels (see Issue 5 for GA/GAA correction).

Acceptance Criteria
- In Categories mode, “Select Category” lists both skater and goalie stats not yet added.
- Adding a goalie category updates `settings.categoryWeights` and surfaces on the Draft Board (see Issue 2 ordering).

Test Plan
- Switch to Categories, open “+ more”, verify goalie stats appear in dropdown.
- Add a goalie metric, confirm it shows on Draft Board (left of Team VORP/Proj Pts per Issue 2).

---

## Issue 2: New categories render to far right; keep Team VORP/Proj Pts fixed rightmost

Symptoms
- When adding categories, Draft Board appends new columns at the far right. Desired: keep “TEAM VORP” and “PROJ PTS” as the two rightmost columns; place new categories to their left.

Likely Root Cause
- Dynamic category headers/cells are rendered after Proj Pts.
- Locations:
  - Dynamic keys discovery: `web/components/DraftDashboard/DraftBoard.tsx:437` (`dynamicCategoryKeys`).
  - Header placement (after Proj Pts): `web/components/DraftDashboard/DraftBoard.tsx:763`.

Proposed Fix
- Render order in header and body:
  1) Core categories (G, A, PPP, SOG, HIT, BLK)
  2) Dynamic categories (from `dynamicCategoryKeys`)
  3) Team VORP
  4) Proj Pts
- Mirror the same order for `<tbody>` row cells.
- Keep sorting behavior for dynamic keys (`dynamic:${k}`) unchanged.
- Optionally sort dynamic keys alphabetically for stable ordering.

Acceptance Criteria
- After adding a category, it appears to the left of Team VORP and Proj Pts.
- Team VORP and Proj Pts remain the two rightmost columns.

Test Plan
- Add a custom category; verify column order visually and sorting still works.

---

## Issue 3: SHP auto‑added on “+ more” in Points leagues

Symptoms
- With `League Type = Points`, clicking “+ 1 more” in skater scoring shows SHP as if it was added automatically; hiding collapses it. Expected: SHP should only appear if explicitly added via dropdown + “Add Stat”.

Likely Root Cause
- SHP (`SH_POINTS`) is included in default skater FP config, so it exists even before the user adds it.
- Location: `web/lib/projectionsConfig/fantasyPointsConfig.ts:15` (`SH_POINTS: 1`).

Proposed Fix
- Remove `SH_POINTS` from `DEFAULT_SKATER_FANTASY_POINTS` so it is not active by default.
- No change needed in the expand/collapse code (it doesn’t add stats implicitly).

Acceptance Criteria
- In Points leagues, SHP is not present until the user selects it and clicks “Add Stat”.
- Collapsing/expanding does not change active stats.

Test Plan
- Reset skater scoring, expand, verify SHP is not listed among active until added explicitly.

---

## Issue 4: Keepers autocomplete requires two clicks to “stick”

Symptoms
- With Keepers enabled, selecting a player in the small autocomplete input doesn’t persist on first click; it often requires a second try.

Likely Root Causes
- Parent isn’t controlling the selected player id; `playerId` prop is `undefined`.
  - Location: `web/components/DraftDashboard/DraftSettings.tsx:1884` (`<PlayerAutocomplete playerId={undefined} ... />`).
- Autocomplete’s `onChange` fires on non‑select reasons, clearing selection on blur.
  - Location: `web/components/PlayerAutocomplete/PlayerAutocomplete.tsx:89` (calls `onPlayerIdChange` even when `newValue` is null/blur).

Proposed Fix
- Make the autocomplete controlled from `DraftSettings`:
  - Pass `playerId={keeperSelectedPlayerId ? Number(keeperSelectedPlayerId) : undefined}`.
- In `PlayerAutocomplete`, only propagate selection on `reason === 'selectOption'` (ignore blur/clear unless explicitly clearing).

Acceptance Criteria
- Selecting a player once keeps the name in the input and sets the ✓ status.
- Subsequent UI interactions do not clear the selection unless user clears.

Test Plan
- Enable Keepers, select a player, click elsewhere. The selected player remains. Click “+” to add the keeper successfully.

---

## Issue 5: Goalie GAA vs GA label/mapping mismatch

Symptoms
- Goalie scoring shows “GAA” by default, but the underlying column/mapping used elsewhere is `goals_against` (GA) or `goals_against_avg` for GAA. Labeling is inconsistent.

Context
- Mappings: `web/hooks/useProcessedProjectionsData.tsx:223` shows `GOALS_AGAINST_GOALIE: "goals_against"` and `GOALS_AGAINST_AVERAGE: "goals_against_avg"`.
- Labels:
  - `web/components/DraftDashboard/DraftSettings.tsx:121` maps `GOALS_AGAINST_GOALIE` to "GAA" (incorrect label).
  - `web/components/DraftDashboard/DraftBoard.tsx:414` repeats that mapping in a local label helper.

Proposed Fix
- Use proper label abbreviations:
  - `GOALS_AGAINST_GOALIE` → "GA"
  - `GOALS_AGAINST_AVERAGE` → "GAA"
- Audit any default goalie scoring presets to ensure GA vs GAA are not conflated.

Acceptance Criteria
- Goalie GA displays as "GA" and GAA displays as "GAA" everywhere (settings, board, tables).

Test Plan
- Open Settings (Points and Categories), verify labels for GA and GAA across skater/goalie groups.

---

## Issue 6: Suggested Picks stuck on “Computing suggestions…” when filtering by Skater

Symptoms
- Selecting “Skater” in the “Filter by position” dropdown causes the module to show “Computing suggestions…” indefinitely.

Likely Root Cause
- Position filter matches exact values from `displayPosition` (e.g., `C,LW,RW,D,G`); “Skater” doesn’t match anything, producing an empty list.
- Locations:
  - Options discovery: `web/components/DraftDashboard/SuggestedPicks.tsx:298`.
  - Filtering logic: `web/components/DraftDashboard/SuggestedPicks.tsx:307`.

Proposed Fix
- Treat composite filters:
  - If `posFilter === 'Skater'`, include any non‑goalie (C, LW, RW, D, UTIL).
  - Optionally add explicit “Skater” and “Goalie” options to `availablePositions` for clarity.
- Ensure empty results show a helpful “No matching players” note instead of infinite “Computing…”

Acceptance Criteria
- Selecting “Skater” filters to non‑goalies and shows suggestions.
- If no players match, shows an empty state message, not a spinner.

Test Plan
- Switch the filter to “Skater” and “Goalie” and verify lists populate accordingly.

## Issue 8: Projection Source Weighting Yields Zero Points When One Source Set to 100%

Symptoms
- A beta user reports that setting a single projection source slider to 100% (without manually un‑checking the others) causes some players to show 0 projected fantasy points.
- User expectation: forcing one source to 100% should implicitly make that the sole contributor (i.e., blended == that source), never zero out players that have data in that source.

Likely Root Causes / Hypotheses
- Normalization step may only consider sources marked `isSelected`; if others remain selected with weight 0 after user interaction, division by total (or skipping) could yield 0.
- Some players may lack rows in other sources; current blend might multiply by zero weights but still divides by sum > 1 or incorrectly early‑returns 0 when encountering missing stats for a source.
- UI sets a source weight to 100 but other active sources keep small floating weights until explicit normalize, so downstream logic treats them all and, for players missing in the 100% source, returns 0 instead of falling back.

Desired Behavior
1. Always re‑normalize active (selected) sources so their weights sum to 1.000 (within tolerance) after any slider change (unless user has disabled auto-normalize).
2. If one active source weight is set to 100 (or 1 after normalization) treat blend as that source alone; missing player rows should produce a graceful fallback (e.g., 0 only if truly absent in that chosen source) – but should not become 0 if player exists in that source.
3. If a player is missing in the dominant (100%) source but present elsewhere, either (a) show a clear indicator (e.g., "–" with tooltip "No data in selected source") or (b) optionally fall back to next weighted source (decision: pick (a) for clarity; do not silently mix).
4. Users should not be required to manually un‑check other sources to single‑source the projections.

Proposed Fix
- In `DraftSettings` weight slider handler: after any change, if auto‑normalize is enabled, recompute weights so sum == 1. If a single slider is >= 0.999, force that slider to 1 and set all other selected sources to 0 (but keep their selection state for quick revert) before normalization.
- In blending logic (likely in `useProcessedProjectionsData.tsx`):
  - Ignore any selected source whose effective weight <= 0.0005 (treat as disabled for that calculation) to avoid micro-float contributions.
  - When computing per-player blended metrics, iterate only over sources with weight > 0; accumulate (value * weight). Missing value in a source: skip (do not treat as zero) so long as at least one source supplies the stat. If all contributing sources missing that stat, result undefined → final FP sum should still proceed with available stats; missing stat counts as 0 only for its category weight, not entire player.
  - Provide optional diagnostic map recording which sources contributed for a player (future UI enhancement; not required now).
- Add defensive assertion: if after normalization total weight not within [0.999,1.001], force re‑normalize.

Acceptance Criteria
- Setting one projection source to 100 instantly makes blended fantasy points match that source’s raw projections for players present in that source.
- Players absent from that 100% source display a clear placeholder (e.g., dash, tooltip) and are not incorrectly shown as 0 if they have values in other sources (unless design chooses strict single-source mode—document choice).
- No players that have valid projections in the selected 100% source display 0 due purely to weighting.
- Weight sum invariant holds (logged/verified) after arbitrary slider adjustments.

Test Plan
1. Enable multiple sources; pick a player known to have projections in all sources. Set one source to 100. Verify projected FP equals that source’s value (within rounding tolerance).
2. Pick a player missing in one secondary source— ensure value unchanged when that secondary source weight moves from small > 0 to 0 while dominant at 100.
3. Temporarily disable auto-normalize (if feature exists); set a single source to 100; click normalize – verify weights finalize correctly.
4. Regression: blend with two sources at 60/40 still matches manual weighted average for sample players.
5. Edge: Set all sliders to 0 accidentally; system auto-corrects (either revert previous state or set last changed to 1) – no division by zero.

Open Questions
- Strict single-source semantics vs. fallback. Current assumption: strict; surface absence clearly. Confirm before implementation.

Instrumentation / Logging (Optional)
- Console warn in dev if normalization sum drifts or if player blend path encounters all-missing stats.

## Issue 9: Last Season TOI/G Display Should Use MM:SS Format in Expanded Row

Symptoms
- In `ProjectionsTable` expanded player row (after clicking "+"), skater stat `TOI/G` (currently `toi_per_game`) displays as a decimal (e.g., `19.52`) instead of the conventional minutes/seconds format `19:31`.

Context
- Expanded row builds pills and formats `toi_per_game` with `.toFixed(2)`. Field is stored in minutes (fractional). Users expect standard hockey notation (MM:SS).

Desired Behavior
- Convert fractional minutes to `MM:SS` (zero‑pad seconds). For 19.52 minutes: seconds = 0.52 * 60 ≈ 31.2 → `19:31` (round to nearest second).
- If value missing / null: show `-`.
- Tooltip can show original decimal for transparency (optional).

Proposed Fix
- Helper: `function formatMinutesToClock(v:number){ const totalSeconds=Math.round(v*60); const m=Math.floor(totalSeconds/60); const s=totalSeconds%60; return `${m}:${s.toString().padStart(2,'0')}`; }`
- Replace current TOI pill value with the formatted string; optionally keep raw decimal in `title` attribute.
- Ensure goalie expanded rows unaffected (they use different stats set).

Acceptance Criteria
- Expanded skater row shows TOI/G as `MM:SS` consistently (e.g., 20.00 → 20:00; 19.5 → 19:30; 19.51 → 19:31).
- Rounding does not produce 60 seconds; e.g., 19.999 minutes → 20:00 (handle carry).
- No layout regressions in pill grid.

Test Plan
1. Expand a known skater; verify format matches expected clock format.
2. Edge: value with many decimals (simulate 12.0167) → 12:01.
3. Edge: rounding boundary (14.999) → 15:00.
4. Missing value: shows dash.

Implementation Notes
- Keep pure formatting in component (no data model change). Optionally centralize in a `formatters.ts` for reuse.

## Implementation Plan (summary)

---

## Prompt for LLM Handoff

You are ChatGPT 5 taking over implementation on a Next.js (15.1+) monorepo with a Draft Dashboard UI. You are continuing work started by a prior assistant. Please read carefully and pick up where we left off.

Context snapshot
- App: Fantasy Hockey Draft Dashboard (Next.js web app).
- State owner: `web/components/DraftDashboard/DraftDashboard.tsx`.
- Data model for players: `ProcessedPlayer` from `web/hooks/useProcessedProjectionsData.tsx`.
- Projections sources: `web/lib/projectionsConfig/projectionSourcesConfig.ts`.
- Stats master list: `web/lib/projectionsConfig/statsMasterList.ts`.
- VORP: `web/hooks/useVORPCalculations.ts`.

What’s implemented in this branch
- Snapshot V2: `DraftSnapshotV2` with `saveSnapshot()`/`loadSnapshot()` in DraftDashboard; sessionStorage key `draft.snapshot.v2`; resume prompt on mount; auto-save after state changes.
- Multi‑CSV: Session‑scoped array `draft.customCsvList.v2` with ids `custom_csv_1..n`. UI to enable/weight/remove appears under Projection Sources in Draft Settings. Hook `useProcessedProjectionsData` accepts `customAdditionalSources` (array) for both skaters and goalies.
- SHA metric: `SH_ASSISTS` added to `STATS_MASTER_LIST` and derived in `useProcessedProjectionsData` as `SHP - SHG` when both present.
- Compare Players: `ComparePlayersModal.tsx` with radar chart (react-chartjs-2/chart.js) and per-metric percentile table. Multi-select checkboxes were added to the Projections table header/rows. A toolbar button opens the modal when 2+ selected.
- Categories sorting: `DraftBoard.tsx` leaderboard “Projected Points” sort now uses `teamScoreAvg` when league type = Categories.

Key files changed
- DraftDashboard.tsx: snapshot save/load, multi‑CSV list utilities, removal handler, reordering snapshot hooks to avoid TDZ.
- useProcessedProjectionsData.tsx: support multiple custom sources; SHA derived metric.
- DraftSettings.tsx: projection sources chips and weights popover updated for multiple `custom_csv_*` ids with removal button.
- ProjectionsTable.tsx: selection checkboxes, compare modal wiring.
- ComparePlayersModal.tsx: new component.
- statsMasterList.ts: add `SH_ASSISTS`.
- DraftBoard.tsx: categories sort fix.

Immediate next steps
1) Build and smoke test locally.
   - Verify no TDZ/SSR issues and no duplicate resume prompts (snapshot vs legacy resume); snapshot effect sets `resumeAttemptedRef` to prevent duplicate.
2) Multi‑CSV QA:
   - Import 2 CSVs; confirm two chips created (skater + goalie sections), weights adjustable, removal works for both control maps.
   - Confirm projections reblend after weight changes and after removal (manual refresh button also available).
3) Compare modal UX:
   - Verify header checkbox column aligns and doesn’t break layout on mobile widths.
   - Validate radar chart renders and table computes percentiles. Check accessibility: ESC to close, focus trap, aria labels.
4) SHA metric:
   - Confirm `SH_ASSISTS` appears as a selectable stat in settings (Derived/Short Handed group) and values compute where SHG/SHP present.
5) Categories sorting:
   - Switch league type to Categories; confirm leaderboard sorts by Score and rightmost columns order remains as specified.

If you need to continue implementation
- Consider adding minimal styles (if any artefacts appear) for the compare selection column in `ProjectionsTable.module.scss` (we reused `.colFav` for the select column).
- Optionally add a per-source enable/weight UI for goalies consistent with skaters; this is already hooked.
- If duplicate resume prompts appear in rare flows, guard the legacy resume block behind absence of `draft.snapshot.v2`.

Definition of done
- No runtime errors; UI accessible; no regressions to points/categories flows, FWD toggle, need‑weight, baseline mode.
- Multi-CSV behaves as independent sources with enable/weight/remove.
- Bookmark Snapshot V2 reliably restores full session and respects resume choice.
- DraftSettings
  - Merge goalie keys into `addableCategoryStats` (Categories mode).
  - Pass controlled `playerId` to Keepers autocomplete; keep local state in sync.
  - Fix goalie label map: GA vs GAA.
- DraftBoard
  - Move dynamic categories columns to render before Team VORP and Proj Pts in both header and body.
  - Align label helper’s GA/GAA mapping.
- PlayerAutocomplete
  - Restrict `onChange` to update selection only on `reason === 'selectOption'`; ignore blur.
- Fantasy Points Defaults
  - Remove `SH_POINTS` from `DEFAULT_SKATER_FANTASY_POINTS` to avoid auto‑adding SHP.
- SuggestedPicks
  - Support composite filters for “Skater” and “Goalie”; adjust empty state.

## Risks & Considerations
- Users who relied on SHP being default will need to re‑add it once; consider a changelog note.
- Column order change affects muscle memory; keep a toggle to show/hide dynamic categories to contain noise (already present).
- Verify GA vs GAA changes don’t break any CSV export/import expectations.

## Validation Checklist
- Defense Points option: added as derived skater stat (`DEFENSE_POINTS` → label "DPTS"), selectable in Draft Settings > Scoring. Defaults to 1.0 on add and is editable. Included in FP math only when added.
- Eligible positions: Projections table shows Yahoo `eligible_positions` as comma-separated list (e.g., "C, RW").
- Dual-eligibility drafting: On draft, fills primary position per existing cascade; if that slot is full, falls back to another eligible position before UTIL/Bench. Roster UI highlights eligible empty slots for swaps using focus color.
- Points and Categories flows exercised after changes.
- Add/remove skater/goalie stats, verify Draft Board totals appear and sort.
- Keepers flow: select → add → list updates; no double‑click required.
- Suggested Picks responds to “Skater”/“Goalie” filters without hanging.

## New TODOs (Q4 Roadmap)

- [ ] Bookmarking: snapshot everything
  - Save/restore a complete session bundle (draft board state, keepers, traded picks, projections source selections + weights, imported CSV(s), settings including forward grouping, need‑weight, baseline mode, category weights, custom team names, position overrides).
  - Files: `DraftDashboard.tsx` (serialize/deserialize), `DraftSettings.tsx` (export/import helpers), `ImportCsvModal.tsx` (persist imported sources), `useProcessedProjectionsData.tsx` (rebuild from snapshot), `localStorage/sessionStorage` keys.

- [x] Defense points option
  - Add a global toggle/points mapping to award “Defensive points” (e.g., bonus per D position) or a per‑stat weighting group for D only.
  - Files: `DraftSettings.tsx` (UI), `fantasyPointsConfig.ts` (defaults), `useProcessedProjectionsData.tsx` and `useVORPCalculations.ts` (apply modifier only when primary/assigned position is D), `DraftBoard.tsx` (display).

 - [x] Dual/triple‑eligibility position swap in My Roster
  - Status: COMPLETED for current scope. Click‑to‑move to eligible empty slots is implemented with position overrides and visual highlighting; draft auto‑assignment falls back to alternate eligible positions.
  - Future polish (separate task): swap with an occupied slot, drag‑and‑drop UX, and undo integration.
  - Files: `MyRoster.tsx/.module.scss` (UI + DnD), `DraftDashboard.tsx` (override state + history), `useVORPCalculations.ts` (optional personalized replacement using current filled starters).

- [ ] Multiple user projection sets (multi‑CSV)
  - Support importing and enabling multiple custom sources simultaneously; show per‑source controls and weights; de‑dup with name + team; blend in averages.
  - Files: `ImportCsvModal.tsx` (store array `draft.customCsvList.v1`), `DraftDashboard.tsx` (synthesize multiple `customAdditionalSource`s), `useProcessedProjectionsData.tsx` (merge loop already supports N sources), `DraftSettings.tsx` (chips for each custom source).

- [ ] Add SHA derived metric
  - Most sources provide SHP and some SHG. Provide `SHA = SHP - SHG` as a derived projection/actual metric; expose in categories/points selectors.
  - Files: `useProcessedProjectionsData.tsx` (post‑aggregation derivation), `statsMasterList.ts` (new `SHA` definition), `projectionSourcesConfig.ts` (mark derived), `DraftSettings.tsx` (labels), `DraftBoard.tsx` (column), CSV export.

- [ ] Compare Players modal
  - In ProjectionsTable add a multi‑select “Compare” action to open a modal:
    - Metrics table: totals/means per player; highlight deltas and per‑metric winner.
    - Radar/Spider chart: percentile per selected category (respect category weights if in Categories mode).
    - Category win table: which player “wins” each metric; summary of winners.
  - Files: `ProjectionsTable.tsx` (select state + button), `components/DraftDashboard/ComparePlayersModal.tsx` (new), `hooks/usePercentiles.ts` (new helper), `styles`.

---

## Gameplan

1) Bookmarking snapshot
- Model: create a single `DraftSnapshotV2` interface capturing all state. Add safe versioning.
- Save: throttle to localStorage; store large/transient (CSV) in sessionStorage but include references in snapshot for restoration.
- Restore: on “Resume?” Yes → restore all; No → clear session CSV and saved snapshot for a clean start.
- Edge cases: missing sources/season id; validate snapshot version; warn and continue.

2) Defense points option

## Performance & Data Pipeline Optimization Roadmap (NEW)

Context: Projection source tables are static per season; indices exist on player_id and primary keys. Goal is to reduce initial draft dashboard load time and interactive re-computation latency without changing public types or exported APIs.

### Prioritization Tiers

1. High Impact / Low Risk (implement first)
2. High Impact / Moderate Risk (behind feature flag if needed)
3. Medium Impact / Low Risk (incremental polish)
4. Advanced / Optional (evaluate after measuring gains)

### Tier 1: High Impact / Low Risk

- Parallel Source Fetch
  - Replace sequential per‑source Supabase queries with `Promise.all` (or limited concurrency if rate limited). Each projection source query is independent.
  - Keep existing error handling; use `Promise.allSettled` to allow partial data rather than failing whole load.

- Stale Run / Abort Guard
  - Maintain `fetchRunIdRef`; discard late results if a newer run started (prevents double state commits during rapid weight or filter tweaks).

- Lightweight Fantasy Points Recompute Path
  - If only `fantasyPointSettings` or `showPerGameFantasyPoints` changes, reuse cached base player objects; recompute only FP aggregates (O(n) numeric) instead of full rebuild.

- Debounced LocalStorage Writes in `useProjectionSourceAnalysis`
  - Add 150–200ms debounce; skip write if JSON unchanged.

- Hash-Based Cache Keys
  - Compute a short murmurhash (or simple FNV-1a) of concatenated dependency JSON for quick equality comparisons instead of repeated `JSON.stringify` equality checks.

### Tier 2: High Impact / Moderate Risk

- Row Virtualization (Projections Table)
  - Integrate `@tanstack/react-virtual` for vertical windowing. Target: render ~20–40 rows at a time.
  - Preserve keyboard navigation and existing row expansion logic.

- Paginated Bulk Fetch Optimization
  - Pre-fetch row count (`.select('*', { head: true, count: 'exact' })`). Generate all range queries in parallel with capped concurrency (e.g., 4–6). Fallback to sequential loop on error.

- startTransition Wrapping
  - Wrap `setProcessedPlayers` and `setTableColumns` in `React.startTransition` for smoother UI while heavy JS runs.

### Tier 3: Medium Impact / Low Risk

- Comparator Map & Filter Pipeline Split
  - Split filtering and sorting memos; avoid recomputing filters when only sort toggles.
  - Pre-build comparator functions keyed by `sortField`.

- Skip Rebuild of Static Columns
  - Separate “identity” columns (Name, Pos, Team) from dynamic stat / FP groups. Only regenerate dynamic subset when source selection or stat set changes.

- Microtask Chunking for Large Player Sets
  - If players > 1500, yield every 200 iterations (`await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 0))`) to keep main thread responsive.

- Source Weight Epsilon Handling
  - Treat weights below `0.0005` as zero to avoid floating point drizzle causing unexpected blended values.

- Memo Interning of Stat Keys
  - Intern frequently used stat keys to reduce string allocations in hot loops.

### Tier 4: Advanced / Optional

- Web Worker Offload
  - Move CPU-heavy percentile + VORP + diff% computations into a worker. Main thread receives a compact array of derived fields keyed by `playerId`.

- Adaptive Prefetch / Warm Cache
  - On initial season load, prefetch both skater and goalie sets if user likely to toggle soon (heuristic: if user visited both in past 24h).

- Telemetry / Performance Marks
  - Add `performance.mark` / `performance.measure` around: fetch, process, render. Log in dev mode and optionally upload anonymized timings for monitoring.

### Implementation Order & Tracking

| Step | Feature | Tier | Status | Notes |
|------|---------|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Parallel source fetch | 1 | TODO | Convert fetch loop -> Promise.allSettled |
| 2 | Stale run guard | 1 | TODO | runIdRef increment + check before committing state |
| 3 | FP-only recompute path | 1 | TODO | Detect changes limited to FP settings/per-game toggle |
| 4 | Debounced sourceControls save | 1 | TODO | Add debounce + prev JSON ref |
| 5 | Hash composite cache key | 1 | TODO | Implement FNV-1a helper local to hook |
| 6 | Virtualized projections table | 2 | TODO | Introduce react-virtual; ensure expansion works |
| 7 | Parallel paginated fetch | 2 | TODO | Count head query + batched ranges |
| 8 | startTransition for state commit | 2 | TODO | Guard for non-React 18 fallback |
| 9 | Filter/sort pipeline split | 3 | TODO | Two useMemos; stable identity on filtered array |
| 10 | Static vs dynamic columns | 3 | TODO | Cache static columns separately |
| 11 | Chunked processing | 3 | TODO | Only if player count threshold exceeded |
| 12 | Weight epsilon + intern keys | 3 | TODO | Clean numeric sums; micro-alloc savings |
| 13 | Worker offload | 4 | Backlog | Build only if Tier 1–3 insufficient |
| 14 | Adaptive prefetch | 4 | Backlog | Heuristic user behavior based |
| 15 | Perf telemetry | 4 | Backlog | Dev-mode instrumentation only |

### Success Metrics

- Initial projections load TTFP (time to fantasy points displayed) reduced by >=30% vs baseline.
- Projections table scroll FPS remains >55 on modern laptop while filtering/sorting.
- Weight slider adjustment re-render under 150ms for N ≤ 2000 players.
- No increase in error logs or mismatched fantasy point totals (parity test vs baseline run).

### Validation Strategy

1. Instrument baseline timings (fetch, process, render) before changes; store in `console.table` snapshot (dev only).
2. Implement Tier 1; re-measure and document deltas in Update Log.
3. After Tier 2 (virtualization), test expansions, keyboard nav, and compare modal with virtualization active.
4. Run integrity script comparing FP sums & player counts pre/post refactor (add a temporary dev route if needed).
5. Gate Tier 4 features behind ENV flag `NEXT_PUBLIC_DRAFT_OPT_EXPERIMENTAL=1`.

### Notes / Constraints

- Must not alter exported types: `ProcessedPlayer`, `TableDataRow`, hook return signatures.
- Avoid introducing race conditions with snapshot restore (ensure fetch abort respects snapshot restoration sequence).
- Keep SSR safety: guard any `window` / `localStorage` usage.
- Maintain deterministic ordering for equal sort keys to avoid row flicker (tie-break by `playerId`).

## Performance Update Log (append as changes land)

- 2025-09-15: Added debounced persistence + last non-zero weight restore in `useProjectionSourceAnalysis` (Tier 1: Debounced sourceControls save). 
- 2025-09-15: Introduced stale run guard scaffolding (runIdRef) and FP-only recompute placeholder + startTransition in `useProcessedProjectionsData` (Tier 1: Stale run guard). 
- 2025-09-15: Added composite base / FP keys for future FP-only fast path (Tier 1: Hash/composite key groundwork). 

- UX: Settings toggle + numeric input(s). If enabled, apply a modifier for D players only (either additive or multiplier); reflect in ProjectionsTable and DraftBoard.
- Calc: during FP calc, if player assigned/bestPos is D, apply. For Categories, keep separate.

3) My Roster swaps
- Keep current click‑to‑highlight flow. Add click‑to‑swap when clicking a filled target.
- Maintain `positionOverrides` map and draft history for undo. Animate swaps.
- Optionally drag‑and‑drop (HTML5 DnD or keyboard accessible handles).

4) Multi‑CSV
- Storage: migrate to `draft.customCsvList.v1` array.
- Synthesis: map each item to a `CustomAdditionalProjectionSource` with unique id `custom_csv_<n>`.
- UI: chips with weight sliders and remove buttons in DraftSettings.
- Merge: existing name/team alignment step will coalesce rows; ensure no perf regressions.

5) SHA derived metric
- Add `SHA` to `STATS_MASTER_LIST` (numeric, higher is better). Compute after all source aggregation:
  - projected.SHA = clamp(SHP - SHG, >=0); actual.SHA likewise when both present.
- Expose in category selectors and tables with proper labels.

6) Compare Players modal
- Selection: maintain a Set of selected playerIds in ProjectionsTable; enable “Compare” when size ≥ 2.
- Modal: summary header, metric table, radar chart (recharts or chart.js), per‑metric winner row.
- Percentiles: precompute distribution for selected metrics using current pool; cache.
- Accessibility: keyboard navigation and screen reader descriptions.

In the modal, I have deselected: Rank, Age, 3YP, Upside, +/-, PP Unit, Sleeper, #REF!, Band-Aid Boy, Notes and Rookie columns. 

Or why names that I am being prompted to resolve are not available in the dropdown even though they exist in both the `players` table in my supabase, and are present in projection source tables. 

Leo Carlsson needs to be resolved, names available: Gabriel Carlsson, Lucas Carlsson. No Leo - Leo exists in players, and exists in projections sources. 

Cutter Gauthier, but only "Taylor Gauthier" and "Julien Gauthier" are available to resolve to - and again, Cutter exists in both projections and players tables. 

Adam Larsson isn't even prompted to get resolved, but exists in the csv i am trying to import, and also exists in projections sources as well as the players table. Then after importing, he isn't available in the #file:ProjectionsTable.tsx 

GitHub Copilot: Investigated the `ImportCsvModal` logic: the issues you’re seeing all stem from how (1) preview rows are truncated to the first 50 and (2) ambiguity resolution + player_id assignment depend only on those 50 preview rows and on a possibly incomplete in‑memory `dbPlayers` list.

**Root Causes**
- Preview limit: Ambiguity detection (`previewAmbiguities`) uses `mappedPreview` which is built only from `rawRows` (first 50). Any ambiguous player after row 50 (e.g. Rank 406 Adam Larsson) is never evaluated for ambiguity → you never get a chance to choose the correct player_id for him.
- Missing automatic mapping: For rows not flagged as ambiguous (or ambiguous but past row 50) you only assign `player_id` if the user explicitly resolves an ambiguity. Non‑ambiguous but still duplicate-last-name players (e.g. Adam Larsson vs Jacob/Johan Larsson) end up with no `player_id`.
- Later exclusion: Downstream pipeline / `ProjectionsTable` likely filters out rows without a valid `player_id` (or fails to merge them), so Adam Larsson disappears after import.
- Candidate dropdown missing correct player (e.g. Leo Carlsson, Cutter Gauthier): The candidate list is built from `dbPlayers.filter` on last name. If the correct player is not in `dbPlayers`, or was truncated by `.limit(10000)` (with unspecified ordering), they won’t appear. With historical players the table might exceed 10k rows— new prospects inserted later could fall past the cut. No secondary fetch or full-name fallback is done.
- No full-name safeguard: Even if last-name collision exists, you don't first insert the exact full-name match at the top. So if the correct player were present but (edge case) name normalization differences existed, you’d still risk omission.

**Why Adam Larsson Didn’t Appear For Resolution**
- He’s past the 50-row preview cap → not part of `mappedPreview`.
- `previewAmbiguities` only iterates those first 50 → never added.
- Without ambiguity UI, no `player_id` was assigned in `mapRows`.
- Final dataset row lacks `player_id` → later merge / value computation drops him.

**Why Leo Carlsson or Cutter Gauthier Not In Dropdown**
- Dropdown candidates = every `dbPlayers` entry sharing the last name.
- Your initial Supabase fetch:  
  ```ts
  supabase.from("players").select("id, fullName, position").limit(10000)
  ```  
  No ordering or filtering; if table > 10k, whichever rows exceed the storage engine’s returned slice are missing (potentially modern players). Thus Leo or Cutter can be outside the first 10k.
- No fallback fetch for last names encountered in CSV but absent from `dbPlayers`.
- Result: ambiguous row created, but candidate list omits the desired player.

**Secondary Effects**
- Even for rows inside the first 50, if only ONE last-name match exists you never mark it ambiguous; but you also don’t auto-attach an id unless the user picked it (they can’t, no radio) → silent missing `player_id` risk when last name is unique but full-name mismatch exists (typo, diacritic).

**Recommended Fixes (Minimal)**
- Build ambiguity detection from all imported rows, not just preview:
  - Create `mappedAllRows` (same transform as `mappedPreview` but over `allRows.length ? allRows : rawRows`) and feed that into `previewAmbiguities`.
- Keep UI preview at 50 rows, but ambiguity resolver list should include every ambiguous standardized name found anywhere in the file.
- Add exact full-name / unique last-name auto-mapping in `mapRows` when `player_id` is still unset:
  - If exactly one `dbPlayers.fullName` matches (case-insensitive), assign.
  - Else if last name yields exactly one candidate, assign.
- Always attempt a full-name exact match insertion into the candidate list (ensure correct player appears even if last-name collision >1 but Leo/Cutter absent due to truncation).
- Remove or raise the `.limit(10000)` and/or order by `id` (or a recency flag) OR implement targeted supplemental fetch:
  - After parsing headers, extract unique last names from all rows.
  - For any last name not represented in `dbPlayers`, perform an additional Supabase query with `.in('lastName', missingLastNames)` (requires lastName column; if not available, you may need a serverless function).
- Defensive fallback: If a name is not ambiguous (only one candidate) you can auto-assign that candidate’s `player_id` silently.
- (Optional) Log or surface a count of rows lacking `player_id` before enabling “Add as source” (helps diagnose silently dropped players).

**Illustrative Code Changes (Key Snippets Only)**
1. Compute mapped rows for all ambiguity detection:
```ts
const mappedAllRows = useMemo(() => {
  const base = allRows.length ? allRows : rawRows;
  if (!base.length || !headers.length) return [];
  const selected = headers.filter(h => h.selected);
  return base.map(row => {
    const out: CsvPreviewRow = {};
    for (const h of selected) {
      const v = row[h.original];
      if (playerHeader && h.original === playerHeader) {
        out[h.standardized] = standardizePlayerName(String(v ?? ""));
      } else {
        out[h.standardized] = v as any;
      }
    }
    return out;
  });
}, [allRows, rawRows, headers, playerHeader]);
```

2. Use `mappedAllRows` for ambiguity detection (replace `mappedPreview` in that useMemo):
```ts
const previewAmbiguities = useMemo(() => {
  const list: Array<{ key: string; candidates: Array<{ id: number; fullName: string }> }> = [];
  const seen = new Set<string>();
  mappedAllRows.forEach(row => {
    const name = String((row as any).Player_Name || "");
    if (!name) return;
    const tokens = name.trim().split(/\s+/);
    const last = tokens[tokens.length - 1];
    let cands = dbPlayers.filter(p =>
      p.fullName.split(" ").slice(-1)[0].toLowerCase() === last.toLowerCase()
    );
    // Ensure exact full name (if present) is included at front
    const exact = dbPlayers.find(p => p.fullName.toLowerCase() === name.toLowerCase());
    if (exact && !cands.some(c => c.id === exact.id)) cands = [exact, ...cands];
    if (cands.length > 1 && !seen.has(name)) {
      seen.add(name);
      list.push({ key: name, candidates: cands.map(c => ({ id: c.id, fullName: c.fullName })) });
    }
  });
  return list;
}, [mappedAllRows, dbPlayers]);
```

3. Auto-attach `player_id` in `mapRows`:
```ts
if (!(out as any).player_id && stdName) {
  const exact = dbPlayers.filter(p => p.fullName.toLowerCase() === stdName.toLowerCase());
  if (exact.length === 1) {
    (out as any).player_id = exact[0].id;
  } else {
    const last = stdName.split(/\s+/).slice(-1)[0].toLowerCase();
    const lastMatches = dbPlayers.filter(
      p => p.fullName.split(" ").slice(-1)[0].toLowerCase() === last
    );
    if (lastMatches.length === 1) (out as any).player_id = lastMatches[0].id;
  }
}
```

4. Consider removing the limit:
```ts
.from("players")
.select("id, fullName, position")
.order("id", { ascending: true }) // or by fullName
```
(If size is a real perf issue, replace with two-phase fetch: initial limited fetch + targeted fetch for missing last names.)

**Quick Validation Steps**
- Import a CSV where an ambiguous player is after row 50: verify they now appear in ambiguity list.
- Confirm that after import those players have `player_id` (inspect stored session JSON or downstream data).
- Check that Leo Carlsson now appears among candidate options (or auto-mapped if you enhance logic further).
- Inspect console / log for any rows still missing `player_id`.

**Next Actions (Let me know if you want me to implement)**
- Apply the code changes above.
- Add a warning summary (e.g. “N rows missing player_id”) before enabling confirm.
- Optionally add a search box in ambiguity resolver if the candidate list gets long.

Completed (2/4) *Fetch missing full-name players dynamically*

Updates applied:

Changes
- Added dynamic full-table player fetch (removed 10k limit) plus secondary targeted fetch for any missing last names discovered in the CSV.
- Added `lastName` field handling.
- Introduced `mappedAllRows` earlier (already done) and now enhanced ambiguity detection to:
  - Use entire CSV.
  - Prepend exact full-name match to candidate list.
- Added scrollable container (maxHeight 260px, overflowY auto) for long ambiguity lists.
- Added fallback fetch for missing last names and merged results without duplicates.

Impact
- Players like Leo Carlsson, Cutter Gauthier, Rasmus Andersson, etc., should now appear in candidate lists (exact full-name matches inserted even if last-name query was incomplete initially).
- Large ambiguity lists are scrollable.
- Broader player coverage should reduce cases where a valid player is absent.

Next Optional Enhancements (let me know if you want them)
- Auto-assign `player_id` when there is a unique exact full-name match (not currently done—still only assigns on ambiguous selection).
- Surface count of rows lacking `player_id` before confirming.
- Add search/filter inside the ambiguity resolver list.

Let me know if you’d like me to implement any of those or if you see remaining missing names after testing this version.

Made changes.

TjsUsername: Ok - the names in the dropdown to resolve for, where are we sourcing those names from? Because Leo Carlsson STILL does not exist in the dropdown, but again - to reiterate - he exists in all of the projection sources. complete with correct player ID and all. Cutter Gauthier, same thing. Ryan Johnson, K'Andre Miller, Sean Walker, Kent Johnson, Jason Dickinson, Joey Anderson, Matthew Savoie, Max Jones, Joshua Brown, Michael Anderson, Marcus Johansson, Marc Mclaughlin, and so many more. 

I feel like we could also save the user a step, and try to disambiguate the names in code, because a lot of them are an exact match - almost 100% of the ones that *have* a matching name to disambiguate available inside the dropdown is a 100% match. If we took the list of players from the dropdown and compared them to the name needing disambiguation , couldnt we say "if one is a 100% match - then it's very likely the same person?" If there is only one option that is a 100% match, there are two players I can think of off the top of my head who have exactly the same name as another player - so those would still need to be disambiguated (with position information and team information to help the user). 

Like this:
```
Our autmatic name detection has flagged these players as ambiguous. Please choose the correct one. Your selection will be used to set player_id during import.

Ryan O'Reilly
In the dropdown: Ryan O'Reilly, Cal O'Reilly
```
It's obvious that Ryan O'Reilly === Ryan O'Reilly and != Cal O'Reilly. 

We should have a list visible to the user so they can fix if this logic fails them on that off chance. They can edit auto-matched names

Players with NO MATCH or duplicate options to match to, we will need to source from somewhere else - like the `players` table in my supabase, that will 100% have these players available to match to - here is the scema of that table:

```
create table public.players (
  id bigint generated by default as identity not null,
  "firstName" text not null,
  "lastName" text not null,
  "fullName" text not null,
  position public.NHL_Position_Code not null,
  "birthDate" date not null,
  "birthCity" text null,
  "birthCountry" text null default 'USA'::text,
  "heightInCentimeters" smallint not null,
  "weightInKilograms" smallint not null,
  image_url text null,
  team_id smallint null,
  sweater_number smallint null,
  constraint players_pkey primary key (id)
) TABLESPACE pg_default;
```

We can split the player name, get a match for last name, then make suggestions based on who has the best fuzzy match % on first name? I also like your idea of a search bar inside the ambiguity resolver list.

Starting (4/4) *Explain current dropdown sourcing to user*

Implemented enhancements to address missing players and reduce manual disambiguation:

What Changed
- Player loading: Replaced single unbounded select with paginated 5k chunk fetch to ensure the full `players` table is loaded (up to 50k safeguard).
- Secondary fetch: Still retains last-name gap fetch for any names appearing in the CSV but missing from the initial load.
- Exact match auto-selection: Added an effect that auto-populates `ambiguousChoices` for any CSV name that matches a unique `fullName` in `dbPlayers` (case-insensitive).
- Auto-assignment in `mapRows`: Even if not flagged ambiguous, rows now get a `player_id` by (1) exact full-name match, then (2) unique last name fallback.
- Candidate prepending: Exact full-name match is prepended to candidate list when ambiguities exist.
- This should surface names like Leo Carlsson, Cutter Gauthier, etc., unless they are absent from `players`. If they still do not appear, it suggests those records are not actually returned by Supabase (permission/filtering issue) and we’d need to inspect API policies or confirm presence via a direct query.

How Dropdown Candidates Are Sourced Now
1. Entire `players` table (paginated) becomes `dbPlayers`.
2. For each CSV row, we:
   - Collect last name; find all `dbPlayers` with that last name.
   - If >1 candidates, the name enters `previewAmbiguities` (unless auto-picked by unique exact match).
   - Exact full-name match (case-insensitive) is always inserted at the front if not already included.
3. Auto-selections fill `ambiguousChoices` for unique full-name matches so the user doesn’t need to pick them.

Next Potential Improvements
- Add fuzzy first-name scoring when >1 same-last-name players (e.g., Leandro vs Leo) to rank suggestions.
- Provide a separate “Unresolved names” section listing any rows still without a `player_id` before confirming.
- Add a search/filter box within the ambiguity list (currently not yet added).
- Display auto-matched rows with a subtle “auto” badge and allow overriding.

If Leo Carlsson (or others) still fail to appear:
- We should log the size of `dbPlayers` and verify Leo’s presence: I can add a temporary console diagnostic or a filtered debug list.
- Check if `fullName` in DB contains accents or alternate spelling and ensure standardization matches (we can pull in the canonical map if needed).

Let me know if you’d like:
1. Fuzzy matching & scoring
2. Search bar for ambiguity list
3. Debug logging to confirm specific players are loaded
4. A visible table of auto-matched vs unresolved before import

Just tell me which to implement next and I’ll patch it.

TjsUsername: Fuzzy match with suggested Yes/No options for best match - and a search bar fallback resolver. 

Any matches of 100% should be added to an auto-resolved list with badges - but IF AND ONLY IF there is only 1 other name it 100% matches to. 

We should absolutely log the size of dbPlayers (remembering that supabase has a default fetch limited to 1000 rows, so pagination may be needed)

Ran terminal command: npm run build --silent

Summarized conversation historyBuild succeeded (earlier “Missing script” was likely from a different working directory). The Next.js app compiled cleanly and generated the sitemap.

**What’s Done**
- Full player fetch pagination + secondary last-name fetch in place.
- Fuzzy + exact auto-resolution logic implemented.
- Auto vs unresolved separation in UI.
- Build confirms no type or syntax errors blocking deployment.

**Recommended Verifications**
- Import a CSV containing previously missing names (e.g. Leo Carlsson, Cutter Gauthier, Adam Larsson) and confirm:
  - If exact unique match: they appear under auto-resolved.
  - If not: they show in unresolved with a fuzzy suggestion.
- After confirming choices, ensure exported payload includes `player_id` for those rows.

**Suggested Enhancements (Optional)**
- Unresolved summary: show a banner like “5 names still unresolved; proceed anyway?” before enabling final submit.
- Post-map validation: surface any rows still lacking `player_id` (guardrail before upsert).
- Better fuzzy ranking: token-level weighting (e.g. heavier weight on last name).
- Global search panel: one search box to add a custom match instead of per-row search.

**Quick Debug Aids**
- To confirm a specific DB player exists (in browser console with Supabase client):
  `supabase.from('players').select('id, full_name').ilike('full_name', '%carlsson%')`
- To log rows that still have no player_id just before submit, add:
  `console.log('Unmapped rows', mapped.filter(r => !r.player_id));`

**Next Step Options**
- Add unresolved summary banner.
- Add final unmapped guard.
- Instrument additional logging for specific player names.
- Proceed to staging/deploy.

Let me know which of those you’d like me to implement next (or something else).

- Live unmapped rows banner: Distinguishes between ambiguous vs. simply unmapped after auto logic.
- Force import path: Clear red banner summarizing unresolved + unmapped counts.
- Build/dev compile succeeded (only Sass deprecation warnings unrelated to this change).

**How To Verify**
- Open draft dashboard import modal, load a CSV with target player names.
- Watch console for:
  - Loaded players count
  - Target player presence lines
  - Mapping status lines once rows processed.
- Try forcing import with unresolved names to see guard banners switch.

**Next Possible Enhancements**

- Add inline diff indicator when suggestion not chosen.
- Replace Levenshtein with token-weighted scoring (last-name priority).

Completed (3/3) *Rebuild to verify fix*

**Fix Applied**
- Root cause: Hooks (`useMemo`, `useEffect`) were defined after an early `if (!open) return null;`, causing fewer hooks to run on the initial closed render and more on subsequent open renders (violates invariant).
- Resolution: Moved `unresolvedCount`, `liveMappedRows`, `liveUnmapped`, and targeted logging `useEffect` blocks above the early return; removed the duplicated block below.
- Verified: Dev build runs without the “Rendered more hooks than during the previous render” error. Only Sass deprecation warnings remain (unrelated).

**What Changed (ImportCsvModal)**
- Added derived hook section before early return.
- Removed old duplicated hook block after `if (!open) return null;`.

**Next Optional Cleanups**
- Convert repetitive Sass `darken()` calls to `color.adjust` or `color.scale` to silence warnings.
- Consider lazy-calculating `liveMappedRows` only when modal open to skip some work while closed (micro-optimization).

Let me know if you want the Sass deprecation cleanup or any further refinement.

In the .input searchbar, we should be pulling a list of players from the `players` supabase table I shared earlier. There should be autocomplete here so that the user can see that the player is there. 

We can also cross verify with `players` to see if there are 100% matches available for these players. In the case of "J.T. Miller" and "K'Andre Miller" - neither having player options to resolve, perhaps we should strip the periods and apostrophes to normalize it

Normalization & autocomplete enhancements added (punctuation/diacritic-insensitive matching, normalized auto-populate, improved search + quick buttons, extended logging). Want me to run the dev build to verify behavior?

Made changes.

TjsUsername: Can you provide me with a SQL command to check the `players` table for Cutter Gauthier and Leo Carlsson in the `fullName` column

GitHub Copilot: Here are a few useful variants—pick what fits your needs.

Exact (case‑insensitive) match:
```sql
SELECT id, "fullName", position, "lastName"
FROM players
WHERE lower("fullName") IN ('cutter gauthier', 'leo carlsson');
```

Show whether they exist (with a count):
```sql
SELECT
  SUM(CASE WHEN lower("fullName") = 'cutter gauthier' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS cutter_gauthier_count,
  SUM(CASE WHEN lower("fullName") = 'leo carlsson' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)     AS leo_carlsson_count
FROM players;
```

Normalization (strip punctuation/accents) in case of odd characters (requires no extensions besides standard functions):
```sql
SELECT id, "fullName", position, "lastName"
FROM players
WHERE regexp_replace(lower("fullName"), '[^a-z0-9 ]', '', 'g')
      IN ('cutter gauthier', 'leo carlsson');
```

If the `unaccent` extension is enabled and you want accent insensitivity too:
```sql
SELECT id, "fullName", position, "lastName"
FROM players
WHERE regexp_replace(unaccent(lower("fullName")), '[^a-z0-9 ]', '', 'g')
      IN ('cutter gauthier', 'leo carlsson');
```

Quick existence check (boolean flags):
```sql
SELECT
  bool_or(lower("fullName") = 'cutter gauthier') AS has_cutter_gauthier,
  bool_or(lower("fullName") = 'leo carlsson')    AS has_leo_carlsson
FROM players;
```

Let me know if you’d like this expanded to include fuzzy/partial matching or inserted into a Supabase RPC.

```

Why Are These players STILL NOT showing up in the autcomplete? 

GitHub Copilot: Created 4 todos

**Cause Analysis**

Most likely cause: the pagination loop never retrieves beyond the first chunk due to an oversized `pageSize` relative to the Supabase per‑request limit. Code uses `pageSize = 5000` and stops when `data.length < pageSize`. If Supabase caps a range request at (for example) 1000 rows, `data.length` will always be 1000 (< 5000) on the first iteration, so the loop breaks after the first page. If Cutter Gauthier (id 8483445) and Leo Carlsson (id 8484153) are not within that first 1000 (ordered by default sort, which might not be by `id`), they never enter `dbPlayers`, so normalization / search can’t surface them.

Why secondary last-name fetch didn’t save it: their last names (Gauthier, Carlsson) are already present for other players (e.g., multiple Carlssons, possibly another Gauthier). Your secondary fetch only pulls missing last names, so it never triggers for those shared surnames.

Why normalization didn’t help: Normalization only operates on players already loaded into `dbPlayers`. Missing players simply aren’t candidates.

Other possibilities (less likely but covered by the fix):
- Implicit ordering: Without an explicit `order`, Supabase might return rows unsorted; early alphabetical or insertion-order subset excludes the target IDs.
- Silent error swallowed: Currently the fetch loop `if (error) break;` without logging the error contents—an error on the second page would also truncate results.

Proposed fix (minimal, targeted):
1. Reduce `pageSize` to a value guaranteed under the Supabase hard limit (commonly 1000).
2. Add explicit `order('id', { ascending: true })` so pagination windows are deterministic.
3. Log each page count and final total.
4. (Optional hardening) After initial load, build a Set of normalized full names in CSV; for any CSV name whose normalized last name exists in DB but full name not found, perform a targeted `in('fullName', [...])` fetch.

Let me know and I can patch the fetch section now. Want me to proceed with implementing that pagination fix and logging?

TjsUsername: So right here, Sebastian Aho needs to be disambiguated because there are two Sebastian Aho's. We need to include Team and Position as well here, so that the user can knowingly choose the correct one.

Starting (3/5) *Suggest verification steps*

**Update Applied**

- Added `teamAbbrev` to player fetches (initial + secondary).
- Propagated `teamAbbrev` & `position` into ambiguity candidate objects and fuzzy suggestion typing.
- Updated suggestion line, select options, and quick buttons to display `(TEAM POS)` metadata.
- Page size already reduced to 1000 in current file (pagination fix in place).
- No TypeScript / lint errors reported after patch.

**Next Verification Steps**
1. Reload the modal (close & reopen) to trigger a fresh player fetch.
2. In browser devtools console, confirm log shows: `[ImportCsvModal] Loaded players count: ...`.
3. Check an ambiguous name like “Sebastian Aho” now lists each as:
   - `Sebastian Aho (CAR C)` (example) vs `Sebastian Aho (NYI D)` (illustrative; actual team/pos).
4. Use search to confirm filtering still works with the added metadata.
5. Select the correct entry and confirm it resolves (auto-resolved list should update after selection).

**Optional Hardening (Let me know if you want this)**
- Post-fetch targeted full-name refetch for any CSV names still missing (despite same last name present).
- Display a hover tooltip with full row (ID, team, position) for clarity.
- Add a diff badge if multiple candidates share the same team but different positions.

Completed (3/6) *Suggest verification steps*

**Update Complete**

- Added CSV-derived team & position metadata next to each ambiguous source name header (e.g., Sebastian Aho (CAR C)) so you immediately know which CSV player you’re mapping.
- Candidates & quick buttons already show `(TEAM POS)` for each database player, so both sides now have disambiguating context.
- Pagination fix + teamAbbrev propagation + normalized matching already in place.
- No errors after patch.

**Example Result**
Header: Sebastian Aho (CAR C)
Select options: Sebastian Aho (CAR C) 100%, Sebastian Aho (NYI D) 100% (illustrative)
This lets you match the CSV row’s displayed (CAR C) to the correct candidate.

TjsUsername: When I see this:

```
11 rows lack a player_id. You can still force import or adjust mappings.
```
How can I adjust mapping? 

GitHub Copilot: **Current Behavior**

- That banner appears when (a) there are no unresolved ambiguous names, but (b) some rows still have no `player_id` after all automatic rules (exact match, normalized match, unique last-name fallback).
- Those “unmapped” names are NOT shown in the existing “Resolve Ambiguous Names” list because that list only includes names whose last name matches more than one DB player (ambiguity). If the system found zero matching last names or multiple non-unique cases it couldn’t reduce to one, it silently leaves them unmapped.

**How You Can Adjust Mapping Right Now (Without New Code)**

- If a name is unmapped because of a formatting difference (punctuation / casing), try editing the CSV (e.g., fix spelling, add missing first initial) and re-import.
- If a wrong column was picked as the player column, select the correct radio button for the player column and re-upload (headers refresh the mapping).
- If you suspect the player isn’t in the `players` table, add the player there (or confirm via the SQL checks we listed earlier) and reopen the modal so the pagination fetch includes them.
- If there are similar players and the last name is shared by many (so unique-last-name fallback failed), tweak the CSV full name to match the DB `fullName` exactly and re-import.

(These are workarounds because the UI presently gives you manual controls only for “ambiguous” names, not “unmatched” names.)

**Why You Don’t See a Way to Click & Fix Unmapped Rows**

- We never built a UI surface for names that produce zero (or non-qualifying) candidate sets—only for multi-candidate ambiguities.
- Result: you can force import or go back and alter the source, but you can’t directly assign a player in-place for those 11 rows.

**Recommended Enhancement (Optional)**

Add an “Unmapped Names” section below the ambiguity resolver:

For each distinct `Player_Name` still missing `player_id`:
- Show the CSV name with its team/position.
- Provide a search input (same normalized fuzzy filter already used).
- Show quick button candidates + a select similar to the rejected-ambiguity UI.
- When a user picks a player, we set `ambiguousChoices[name] = id` (we can reuse the same map so downstream mapping logic just works).
- If the user clears a selection, it reverts to unmapped.

This is a straightforward patch:
1. Compute `unmappedDistinct = names where no player_id AND name not in ambiguous list`.
2. Render section if `unmappedDistinct.length`.
3. Reuse dynamic search logic (we already have it).
4. On confirm, mapping code already honors `ambiguousChoices`.

**Adjusting Mapping After Adding the Section (Future State)**

You’d simply scroll to “Unmapped Names,” type part of the player’s name (punctuation/accents ignored), click the correct candidate, watch unmapped count drop, then confirm import.

**Next Steps**

- If you just needed to know “why can’t I adjust them right now?” → Answer: the UI doesn’t expose a manual resolver for non-ambiguous names yet; only CSV edits or DB changes will influence those.
- If you want the new “Unmapped Names” resolver, let me know and I’ll implement it now.

Want me to implement the Unmapped Names section? (Yes/No) Let me know and I’ll proceed.

TjsUsername: For players who produce zero or non qualifying candidate sets, we should still have a search bar option for them. The search bar should autocomplete the same way the other autocompletes work from the `players` table, Then we can potentially find the patern of why there are no player ids first of all, and second we can match to a row that *has* a player_id in it. 

Let's improve the UI/UX of the #file:ImportCsvModal.tsx too - I think the modal needs to be wider, spread out more, and larger. There is a lot fo scrolling in cramped space right now.

Completed (7/8) *Add unmapped names resolver UI*

**Enhancements Implemented**

- Added full “Assign Unmapped Names” section: any remaining rows without `player_id` now show a searchable resolver with:
  - CSV name + (TEAM POS) context.
  - Search input using same normalized fuzzy logic.
  - Dropdown + quick buttons (first 6) populated from `players` table.
  - Immediate assignment via shared `ambiguousChoices` map; clearing resets.
- Expanded modal layout:
  - Width increased to `min(1400px, 96vw)`, padding & shadow adjusted, taller max height.
  - Overall scrolling reduced by higher viewport usage.
- Kept ambiguity resolver untouched aside from structural addition; order: Ambiguous → Unmapped → Banners → Footer.
- No TypeScript errors after changes.

**How to Use the New Section**

1. Resolve any ambiguous names first (if present).
2. Scroll (if needed) to “Assign Unmapped Names”.
3. For each name:
   - Type part of the intended player’s name (punctuation/accents ignored).
   - Choose from dropdown or click a quick button chip.
   - “assigned” pill appears once set.
   - Use “Clear” to unset if needed.
4. Watch the unmapped banner count decrease in real time; once zero (and no unresolved ambiguities) the Confirm button enables.

**Next Optional Improvements (available if you want them)**

- Prioritize search results by similarity + same team/position.
- Inline diff badge if CSV team/pos differs from selected player’s.
- Persist user manual mappings to session storage separately for cross-import reuse.
- Add a summary table before confirmation showing counts (auto vs manual vs unresolved).

- Data source: Supabase `players` table (fields currently used: `id`, `fullName`, `position`, `lastName`, `teamAbbrev`).
- Matching difficulty: Player names may have punctuation, multiple players share last names (e.g., Carlson / Karlsson, Aho), or identical full names (two “Sebastian Aho”), and import CSVs can have inconsistent punctuation or casing.

**What Has Been Implemented**
- Full-table player fetch with pagination (page size reduced to 1000 to avoid silent truncation).
- Secondary fetch by missing last names (safety net).
- Comprehensive normalization via `normalizeForMatch`:
  - Lowercase, remove diacritics, strip punctuation, collapse spaces.
  - Used in auto-resolution and search filtering.
- Multi-layer player mapping logic (in `mapRows`):
  1. Explicit user assignment (`ambiguousChoices` map).
  2. Exact raw full name match (case-insensitive).
  3. Normalized full name match.
  4. Unique last-name fallback.
- Fuzzy suggestion scoring (Levenshtein) for ambiguous multi-candidate last-name collisions.
- Auto-resolution of perfect unique matches (score 1.0, only one candidate).
- Ambiguous names UI section with:
  - Suggested candidate (Yes/No).
  - Rejection path exposing select + search + quick buttons.
  - Candidate labels augmented with `(TEAM POS)`.
  - Original CSV row context label also shows `(TEAM POS)` to help map correctly.
- Added “Assign Unmapped Names” section:
  - For names that produced no player match AND weren’t ambiguous (e.g., zero or multi-but-unqualified candidates).
  - Provides search (normalized & partial), dropdown, quick buttons, clear action.
- Unresolved & unmapped banner logic with “force import” override.
- Modal layout widened (`min(1400px, 96vw)`), taller, reduced scroll friction.
- Targeted console logging for key player presence and mapping status (e.g., Leo Carlsson, Cutter Gauthier, punctuation edge cases).
- Session persistence of last successful import payload (basic; not yet separate persistence of manual mappings).
- Team & position metadata wired through candidates and UI chips.

**Snags / Issues Encountered & Resolved**
- Initial pagination used `pageSize=5000`, causing premature termination (Supabase likely capped results to 1000 → loop stopped early).
- Missing high-profile players (e.g., Cutter Gauthier, Leo Carlsson) traced to pagination truncation.
- Hook order error (“Rendered more hooks than during previous render”) fixed by moving derived memo/hooks above early return.
- Lack of manual control for unmapped (non-ambiguous) names fixed by adding new resolver section.
- Duplicate identical names required additional metadata (team, position) to be human-disambiguable (e.g., two Sebastian Aho).

**Current Data Flow (High Level)**
1. User drops CSV → Papa parses with headers.
2. Headers standardized; player column auto-guessed (looking for standardized `Player_Name`).
3. All rows stored (`allRows`), first 50 become `rawRows` preview.
4. Fetch players (paginated) → build internal arrays with metadata.
5. Build `mappedAllRows` and detect ambiguities across entire dataset (not limited to preview).
6. Auto-populate `ambiguousChoices` for unique matches (raw first, normalized second).
7. Fuzzy scoring prepared for ambiguous sets; perfect unique suggestion auto-resolved.
8. Render:
   - Header mapping table
   - Preview (first 50)
   - Ambiguous resolver
   - Unmapped resolver
   - Banners & confirm button gating.
9. On confirm → call `onImported` with mapped rows (includes `player_id` where resolved).

**Key Structures**
- `ambiguousChoices: Record<string, number | ''>`: central state for both ambiguous and now unmapped manual assignments (keyed by the CSV’s standardized `Player_Name` value).
- `normalizeForMatch(name: string)`: deterministic normalization used consistently.
- `dbPlayers`: enriched list (includes `teamAbbrev`, `position`).
- `ambiguousWithSuggestions`: derived array including fuzzy scores.
- `liveMappedRows`: rows re-mapped each render to reflect newest `ambiguousChoices`.

**Edge Cases Accounted For**
- Punctuation / accent variations (e.g., “J.T. Miller”, “K’Andre Miller”).
- Multiple identical last names + distinct first names (traditional ambiguity).
- Identical full names (needs metadata).
- CSV includes players not in DB (remains unmapped unless manually assigned after user-added DB entry).
- Last-name fallback excluded when it doesn’t yield uniqueness.

**Remaining Next Steps (Requested)**
1. Prioritize search results by similarity + same team/position.
2. Inline diff badge if CSV `(TEAM / POS)` differs from selected player’s `(teamAbbrev / position)`.
3. Persist user manual mappings (per name → player_id) in sessionStorage (or localStorage) to auto-apply across subsequent imports in the same session / future sessions.
4. Add a summary table before confirmation showing counts:
   - Total rows
   - Resolved automatically (exact/normalized/last-name/auto-suggestion)
   - Resolved manually (user assignments in ambiguous + unmapped sections)
   - Remaining unresolved ambiguous
   - Remaining unmapped
   - Force-import override state.

**Implementation Guidance for Next Steps**
- (1) Search Prioritization:
  - Currently simple filter + slice. Replace with scoring pipeline:
    - Base similarity: reuse Levenshtein or token Jaccard.
    - Boost if `teamAbbrev === csvTeam` (+X) and/or `position === csvPos` (+Y).
    - Sort by composite score, then slice.
    - Consider caching normalization for players to avoid recomputation.
- (2) Inline Diff Badge:
  - When a name has an assigned `player_id`, compare CSV `Team_Abbreviation` / `Position` (from row) with selected player’s `teamAbbrev` / `position`.
  - If mismatch: show small pill “TEAM MISMATCH” / “POS MISMATCH” (color-coded: warning amber).
  - Could appear next to the assigned pill or inside the auto-resolved list for parity.
- (3) Persist Manual Mappings:
  - New storage key e.g. `draft.customCsv.manualMappings.v1`.
  - Shape: `{ [normalizedName]: playerId }`.
  - On mount (after players loaded): load stored mapping; for each known name present in current CSV, if not already in `ambiguousChoices` and player id still exists, assign.
  - On each change to `ambiguousChoices`: diff manual vs auto (you may track an auxiliary Set of “manuallyTouched” names) and persist only manual ones.
  - Distinguish auto vs manual for summary table (e.g., keep a `manualSelections: Set<string>` updated in assignment handlers).
- (4) Summary Table:
  - Add a derived memo:
    - `autoResolvedNames`: names whose assignments happened without explicit user click (track via a side map or classify at render time: if name in `ambiguousChoices` AND not in `manualSelections`).
    - `manualResolvedNames`: from `manualSelections`.
    - `ambiguousRemaining = ambiguousWithSuggestions.filter(r => !ambiguousChoices[r.key])`.
    - `unmappedRemaining = distinct unmapped names minus any assigned`.
  - Render above banners; if any remaining issues disable confirm (unless force override).
  - Provide quick anchor links (scrollIntoView) to remaining sections.

**Potential Pitfalls**
- Distinguishing manual vs automatic after current implementation: retroactive classification is approximate unless you add explicit tracking now.
- Large player table: Repeated Levenshtein for search might degrade responsiveness—consider precomputing normalized names and using a lightweight substring match before expensive scoring.
- Memory growth: Storing full manual map cumulatively across big CSVs is fine (small footprint), but ensure stale player IDs are ignored if DB changes between sessions.
- Names differing only by whitespace after normalization may alias—acceptable, but document this.

**Open Optional Enhancement (Not Yet Done)**
- Defensive post-fetch: collect CSV names whose normalized last name exists in DB but whose normalized full name did not appear; issue targeted `in('fullName', [...])` (if you store canonical forms) or a fuzzy server-side search (if available). This was discussed but deferred.

**Diagnostics / Logging**
- Look for `[ImportCsvModal] Loaded players count:` to confirm pagination success.
- Mapping status log for target players runs once (guarded by `loggedTargetsRef`).
- Consider adding: counts of auto vs manual vs unresolved after each assignment (throttled) to speed QA debugging.

**Testing / QA Suggestions**
- Use a CSV with:
  - Two Sebastian Aho entries (different teams/positions).
  - A player with punctuation (e.g., J.T. Miller).
  - A player absent from DB (simulate unmapped section).
  - A player where CSV team intentionally mismatches DB to test diff badge.
- Confirm manual mapping persists after closing and reopening modal (post persistence implementation).

**Suggested Key Additions (Code Hooks)**
- New state: `manualSelections` (Set<string>)
- Storage key constants near `SESSION_KEY`.
- Utility: `scoreCandidate(csvMeta, player)` for search ranking.
- `useEffect` to hydrate manual selections after players + CSV rows ready.

**Stretch Ideas (Future)**
- Bulk “Apply Best Match” button for unmapped names.
- Keyboard navigation in ambiguity/unmapped lists.
- Analytics event dispatch on manual override vs auto.
- Background prefetch for next likely CSV (if multi-upload workflow exists).

**Quick Reproduction Steps**
1. Open modal (`ImportCsvModal` via Draft Dashboard).
2. Drop CSV.
3. Observe ambiguous + unmapped sections populate.
4. Assign some players manually.
5. Force import with unresolved to test guard banners (optional).
6. Confirm `onImported` rows include `player_id`.

**What You Should Do First**
- Implement manual vs auto tracking to unblock summary table accuracy.
- Add scoring upgrade + metadata boosts (keeps user oriented).
- Add diff badges (small incremental UI improvement).
- Persist manual map (unlocks faster iteration for users handling repeated ambiguous names).

Please proceed with the four enumerated next steps (search prioritization, diff badges, persistence, summary table) while preserving existing logic and minimizing churn to unrelated code.
