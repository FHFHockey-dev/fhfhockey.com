Registration is complete: all persistent task IDs above were resolved and section moves verified. Original client setup IDs remain as audit history; do not create duplicate tasks.

Environment: Node 22.11.0 and existing web/node_modules available; Docker running. Existing supabase_*_fhfhockey-super-goal-baseline belongs to another effort; do not reset/mutate it. Port 54322 also has an SSH listener; do not assume localhost is isolated. Provision a distinct isolated test database/container for this project. Stripe and Patreon configuration keys absent from root web/.env.local; Resend key present (no values exposed). No application changes accepted or runtime tests executed yet.

## Foundation review checkpoint
- W01: returned corrections for direct premium payload access after expiry, entitlement date bounds, explicit capability flags/reasons, server entitlement loader, and durable refund delivery state. Not approved.
- W12: isolated DB harness replay in progress; existing baseline stack untouched.
- W13: reviewed df65650ba; returned missing OAuth/mapping/manual-fallback/access-loss acceptance criteria and activation authorization wording. Documentation only; not yet approved.
- No model escalation. W01 and W12 implementation/preparation active; W13 bounded document correction active. Other orders await dependency release.

- W13 preparation APPROVED: 8aa0965da reviewed; expanded checklist and existing link verification accepted, documentation-only diff. Integrated locally. Yahoo remains PARKED; no provider evidence or activation claimed.
