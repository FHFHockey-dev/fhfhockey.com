# Product Requirements Document: Mobile Stats Page Optimization

## Introduction/Overview

The Stats page currently provides comprehensive hockey statistics through a three-column desktop layout with teams grid, quick stats, and leaderboards. While functional on desktop, the mobile experience requires optimization to create a modern, sleek, and elegant UI that improves usability on mobile devices. This feature will transform the Stats page into a mobile-first experience while maintaining the core functionality and visual appeal.

**Problem Statement:** The current Stats page layout doesn't provide an optimal mobile experience, with components that are difficult to interact with on touch devices and layouts that don't leverage mobile-specific interaction patterns.

**Goal:** Create a modern, elegant mobile UI that maintains all current functionality while improving touch interactions, visual hierarchy, and overall user experience on mobile devices.

## Goals

1. **Enhance Mobile Usability**: Implement touch-friendly interactions with proper tap targets (44px minimum)
2. **Improve Visual Hierarchy**: Prioritize teams grid and search functionality at the top, with condensed leaderboards below
3. **Modernize Mobile Design**: Create a sleek, elegant interface using existing design system variables
4. **Optimize Touch Interactions**: Implement swipe gestures and mobile-specific navigation patterns
5. **Maintain Core Functionality**: Preserve all existing features while adapting them for mobile
6. **Improve Performance**: Implement mobile-specific optimizations for faster loading

## User Stories

**As a mobile user, I want to:**
- Immediately see the teams grid and search bar when I load the page so that I can quickly navigate to my team or find players
- Easily tap on team logos with confidence so that navigation feels natural on my touch device
- Scroll through condensed leaderboards below the main content so that I can view player statistics without losing access to primary navigation
- Use swipe gestures for intuitive navigation so that the interface feels modern and responsive
- Access all statistical information in a well-organized mobile layout so that no functionality is lost on smaller screens

**As a hockey fan, I want to:**
- Quickly find my favorite team from a clean, organized 4-column or 8-column grid so that navigation is efficient
- Search for specific players immediately upon page load so that I can access player data quickly
- View leaderboard statistics in a condensed, scannable format so that I can compare player performance easily

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Layout & Structure
1.1. Implement single-column mobile layout that stacks components vertically

### 2. Teams Grid Optimization
2.1. Convert 16-column teams grid to 4-column layout for mobile (8 rows × 4 columns = 32 teams)
2.2. Alternative option: Implement 8-column layout (4 rows × 8 columns = 32 teams)
2.3. Ensure team logos and abbreviations remain clearly visible and tappable
2.4. Maintain team color gradient animations and hover effects adapted for touch
2.5. Implement proper touch targets (minimum 44px) for all team items

### 3. Search Bar Enhancement
3.1. Keep search bar immediately visible on screen at initial load
3.2. Optimize search input for mobile keyboards and autocomplete
3.3. Ensure search functionality remains accessible during page scroll
3.4. Implement touch-friendly clear and search actions

### 4. Leaderboard Condensation
4.1. Reduce height of leaderboard cards for mobile consumption
4.2. Position leaderboards below teams grid and search sections
4.3. Consider tabbed interface for switching between Skater and Goaltender statistics
4.4. Maintain teams grid and search bar visibility when viewing different tabs
4.5. Implement collapsible/expandable sections for detailed statistics

### 5. Touch Interactions
5.1. Implement minimum 44px touch targets for all interactive elements
5.2. Add touch-friendly hover states and active states for buttons and links
5.3. Ensure proper spacing between interactive elements to prevent accidental taps
5.4. Optimize button sizes and padding for thumb navigation

### 6. Quick Stats Adaptation
6.1. Maintain quick stats section with mobile-optimized card layout
6.2. Ensure cards remain readable and interactive on smaller screens
6.3. Adjust typography and spacing for mobile consumption

### 7. Performance Optimization
7.1. Implement lazy loading for images and heavy components below the fold
7.2. Optimize team logo loading for mobile networks
7.3. Ensure smooth scroll performance on mobile devices

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Complete redesign of the desktop layout
- Changes to existing data sources or API endpoints
- Modification of existing color schemes or brand identity
- Implementation of new statistical categories or data points
- Changes to the underlying data structure or database schema
- Removal of any existing functionality
- Integration with external mobile apps

## Design Considerations

### Visual Design
- **Design System**: Utilize existing variables from `vars.scss` without modification
- **New Variables**: Add mobile-specific variables to `vars.scss` as needed for spacing, touch targets, and mobile layouts
- **Color Palette**: Maintain existing team color gradients and brand colors
- **Typography**: Preserve existing font families and scales, adjusting sizes for mobile readability

### Layout Specifications
- **Teams Grid**: 4-column layout (primary choice) or 8-column layout (alternative)
- **Component Order**: Teams Grid → Search Bar → Quick Stats → Leaderboards
- **Sticky Elements**: Teams grid section and search bar remain visible during scroll
- **Tab Interface**: If implemented, tabs for Skater/Goaltender stats with persistent main navigation

### Interaction Design
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px for all interactive elements
- **Gestures**: Implement swipe navigation where appropriate
- **Feedback**: Clear visual feedback for touch interactions
- **Accessibility**: Maintain WCAG compliance for mobile interactions

## Technical Considerations

### Implementation Approach
- **CSS Framework**: Extend existing SCSS modules with mobile-specific breakpoints
- **Responsive Design**: Use existing breakpoint variables and add mobile-first media queries
- **Component Architecture**: Maintain existing React component structure while adding mobile variants
- **State Management**: Preserve existing state management patterns for team selection and filtering

### Dependencies

## Open Questions

1. **Teams Grid Layout**: Should we implement 4-column (8 rows) or 8-column (4 rows) for the teams grid? Initial preference is 4-column for better touch targets.

2. **Tab Implementation**: If we implement tabs for Skater/Goaltender leaderboards, should we include visual indicators for active tabs and smooth transitions?

3. **Search Bar Integration**: Should the search bar be integrated within the teams grid container or positioned as a separate section immediately below?

4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Should we implement a mobile-first approach and enhance for desktop, or maintain separate mobile optimizations?

5. **Animation Performance**: How should we optimize the existing team color gradient animations for mobile performance while maintaining visual appeal?

6. **Leaderboard Depth**: In the condensed mobile leaderboards, should we show top 3, top 5, or top 10 players by default with expand options?
