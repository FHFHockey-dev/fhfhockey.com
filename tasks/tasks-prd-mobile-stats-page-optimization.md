# Task List: Mobile Stats Page Optimization

## Project Context for LLM Continuation

**Project Status:** We have completed Task 1.0 (Enhance SCSS Variables and Mobile Foundation) and Task 2.1 (Convert main layout from 3-column grid to single-column mobile stack). We are continuing with Task 2.0 (Implement Mobile-First Layout Structure).

**What Was Completed:**
- Added comprehensive mobile-specific variables to `web/styles/vars.scss`
- All 5 subtasks of Task 1.0 are complete and committed to git
- ‚úÖ **NEW:** Task 2.1 completed - Converted main layout from 3-column grid to mobile-first single-column stack in `Stats.module.scss`
- Test suite passed (12/12 tests)
- Changes committed with message: "feat: add comprehensive mobile variables to vars.scss"

**Key Variables Added:**
- Mobile breakpoints: `$breakpoint-mobile-xs` (320px) through `$breakpoint-mobile-lg` (480px)
- Touch targets: `$touch-target-min` (44px), `$touch-target-comfortable` (48px), etc.
- Mobile spacing: `$mobile-space-xxs` (4px) through `$mobile-space-xxxl` (40px)
- Mobile typography: Font sizes, line heights, and letter spacing optimized for mobile
- Mobile z-index system: For sticky positioning and overlays
- Mobile animations: Duration and easing variables optimized for touch devices

**Current Implementation Approach:**
- Mobile-first strategy: Start with mobile styles and enhance for larger screens
- Target range: 320px-480px for mobile devices
- Teams grid: Converting from 16-column to 4-column layout (8 rows √ó 4 teams)
- Key priorities: Teams grid and search bar sticky at top, leaderboards condensed below
- Touch optimization: 44px minimum touch targets throughout

**Next Task Ready:** Task 2.2 - Implement sticky positioning for teams grid container at top of mobile layout

## Relevant Files

- `web/styles/vars.scss` - ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Added mobile-specific variables for touch targets, spacing, and breakpoints
- `web/styles/Stats.module.scss` - ‚úÖ **UPDATED:** Implemented mobile-first single-column layout with progressive enhancement
- `web/pages/stats/index.tsx` - Add mobile-specific state management and component restructuring
- `web/components/StatsPage/PlayerSearchBar.tsx` - Optimize search bar for mobile interactions and sticky positioning
- `web/components/StatsPage/LeaderboardCategory.tsx` - Implement condensed mobile layout and touch interactions
- `web/components/StatsPage/LeaderboardCategoryGoalie.tsx` - Implement condensed mobile layout for goalie stats
- `web/components/StatsPage/LeaderboardCategoryBSH.tsx` - Implement condensed mobile layout for BSH stats
- `web/components/StatsPage/MobileTabInterface.tsx` - Create new tabbed interface component for mobile leaderboards (if tabs approach is chosen)

### Implementation Notes

- **Mobile-first approach:** Start with mobile styles and enhance for larger screens
- **Use new mobile variables:** Reference the mobile-specific variables added to `vars.scss`
- **Maintain existing functionality:** All current features must work on mobile
- **Touch targets:** Focus on 44px minimum touch targets throughout implementation
- **Teams grid priority:** Keep teams grid and search bar at top with sticky positioning
- **Leaderboards:** Condense into cards below main content, consider tabbed interface
