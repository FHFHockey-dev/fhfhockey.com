# Task List: Mobile Stats Page Optimization

## Project Context for LLM Continuation

**Project Status:** We have completed Task 1.0 (Enhance SCSS Variables and Mobile Foundation), Task 2.0 (Implement Mobile-First Layout Structure), Task 3.0 (Optimize Teams Grid for Mobile Touch Interactions), and are now working on advanced mobile team grid functionality with modular architecture.

**What Was Completed:**
- Added comprehensive mobile-specific variables to `web/styles/vars.scss`
- All 5 subtasks of Task 1.0 are complete and committed to git
- ✅ **NEW:** Task 2.0 completed - Implemented complete mobile-first layout structure in `Stats.module.scss`
- ✅ **NEW:** Task 3.0 completed - Optimized teams grid for mobile touch interactions
- ✅ **NEW:** Task 3.7 completed - Created modular mobile team list architecture with `MobileTeamList.tsx` component
- ✅ **NEW:** Task 3.8 completed - Implemented smooth morphing animations and dynamic search bar positioning
- ✅ **NEW:** Task 3.9 completed - Fixed scroll detection logic for proper expansion/collapse behavior
- Test suite passed (12/12 tests)
- Changes committed with message: "feat: add comprehensive mobile variables to vars.scss"

**Key Variables Added:**
- Mobile breakpoints: `$breakpoint-mobile-xs` (320px) through `$breakpoint-mobile-lg` (480px)
- Touch targets: `$touch-target-min` (44px), `$touch-target-comfortable` (48px), etc.
- Mobile spacing: `$mobile-space-xxs` (4px) through `$mobile-space-xxxl` (40px)
- Mobile typography: Font sizes, line heights, and letter spacing optimized for mobile
- Mobile z-index system: For sticky positioning and overlays
- Mobile animations: Duration and easing variables optimized for touch devices with smooth morphing

**Current Implementation Approach:**
- **Modular Architecture:** Separate mobile and desktop components with conditional rendering
- **Smart State Management:** `isMobile` state detection with window resize handling
- **Advanced Morphing:** Teams grid smoothly transitions between expanded (4×8 grid) and collapsed (horizontal bar) states
- **Dynamic Positioning:** Search bar dynamically sticks to bottom edge of teams grid container
- **Hardware Acceleration:** CSS animations optimized with `will-change` and `transform` properties
- **Hysteresis Logic:** Prevents jittery scroll behavior with proper expand/collapse thresholds

**Next Task Ready:** Task 4.0 - Create Mobile-Optimized Leaderboard Components
