## üìã IMMEDIATE NEXT PRIORITIES (UPDATED)

## What was accomplished

## Files touched

## Completed tasks (‚úì)
...existing code...

## Next tasks
1. Refactor team label width into a shared SCSS token
   - Define a single variable (e.g., $team-label-width) in styles/vars.scss and use it for .teamLabel, .teamLabelInput, and .teamLabelSpacer to avoid drift.
2. Improve heatmap intensity scaling
   - Current max uses draftedPlayers only; consider using max across allPlayers.fantasyPoints.projected for more stable color scaling early in drafts.
3. MyRoster component improvements (component exists and is implemented)
   - Audit web/components/DraftDashboard/MyRoster.tsx for prop alignment with DraftDashboard (teamStatsList, draftSettings, availablePlayers, allPlayers, onDraftPlayer, etc.).
   - Verify roster slot counts vs draftSettings.rosterConfig; ensure UTIL handling and bench counts match.
   - Optional: add drag-and-drop for reordering within slots/bench. If adopted, use dnd-kit and persist order in state.
   - Add tests for roster progress and slot rendering.
4. Persist team name edits
   - Wire onUpdateTeamName to backend (Supabase or app state) so edits persist across reloads.
5. Round labels UX
   - Ensure .roundLabelsGrid columns exactly match team grid and remain sticky on horizontal scroll if needed.
6. Performance
   - If teamCount*roundsToShow is large, consider virtualizing rows/columns or simplifying DOM (e.g., windowed grid).
7. Testing
   - Add visual/regression tests for grid alignment and sorting. Include unit tests for categoryTotals computed from allPlayers.combinedStats.

## Implementation recommendations
- SCSS tokenization
  - Add $team-label-width: 60px in styles/vars.scss and replace hardcoded 60px in DraftBoard.module.scss selectors (.teamLabel, .teamLabelInput, .teamLabelSpacer).
- Heatmap scaling
  - Compute maxFantasyPoints from allPlayers first; fallback to a sane default if null. Keep getHeatMapIntensity thresholds as percentages.
- MyRoster
  - The component at web/components/DraftDashboard/MyRoster.tsx is present and used by DraftDashboard. Focus on QA and enhancements (prop types, slot correctness, optional DnD) rather than initial implementation.
- Team name persistence
  - If using Supabase, add a table (e.g., draft_teams) with id/name; update via RPC or simple upsert on edit. Debounce saves on blur/enter.
- Accessibility
  - Add aria-labels/titles to cells and inputs. Ensure keyboard focus styling on editable team labels and inputs.

## Key context for next session

## Notes
- Remove outdated references stating MyRoster.tsx is empty; it is already implemented and imported in DraftDashboard.

PROMPT

You are joining mid-project to continue work on a Fantasy Hockey Draft Dashboard (Next.js + React + TypeScript + SCSS Modules + Supabase). Keep changes minimal, type-safe, and aligned with existing patterns.

Context
- Repo root: /Users/tim/Desktop/fhfhockey.com
- App root: /Users/tim/Desktop/fhfhockey.com/web
- Tech: Next.js, TypeScript (strict), CSS Modules (SCSS), Supabase
- Key features already done:
  - VORP/VONA/VBD integrated (hooks/useVORPCalculations.ts)
  - ProjectionsTable enhanced (zebra striping, value bands, baseline toggle)
  - MyRoster exists and is implemented; it uses usePlayerRecommendations and consumes VORP metrics
  - PRD updated: tasks/prd-draft-dashboard.md (reflects MyRoster presence)
- Important types/hooks to be aware of:
  - hooks/useProcessedProjectionsData.tsx (ProcessedPlayer, TableDataRow union, fantasyPoints projected/actual, ADP fields)
  - lib/projectionsConfig/fantasyPointsConfig.ts (defaults)
  - styles/vars.scss (centralized tokens; contains many existing variables)

Primary Targets for this session
1) SCSS tokenization for team label width
   - Add a shared token: $team-label-width: 60px in web/styles/vars.scss.
   - Refactor any hardcoded widths in Draft Board styles to use this token (likely in web/components/DraftDashboard/DraftBoard.module.scss):
     - .teamLabel
     - .teamLabelInput
     - .teamLabelSpacer
   - Acceptance:
     - All three selectors use $team-label-width.
     - Visual alignment unchanged vs current UI.

2) Heatmap intensity scaling improvement
   - Current intensity uses draftedPlayers-only max; change to a more stable early-draft baseline:
     - Compute max from allPlayers.fantasyPoints.projected if available, else fall back to previous behavior or a sane default.
   - Likely files: web/components/DraftDashboard/DraftBoard.tsx and/or a local helper it uses for getHeatMapIntensity.
   - Acceptance:
     - Early rounds no longer over-saturate or under-saturate drastically.
     - No runtime errors if fantasyPoints.projected is null; uses fallback.

3) MyRoster QA pass (component exists; enhance and validate)
   - Path: web/components/DraftDashboard/MyRoster.tsx
   - Ensure prop alignment with DraftDashboard:
     - teamStatsList, draftSettings, availablePlayers, allPlayers, onDraftPlayer, canDraft, currentPick, currentTurn, teamOptions
     - VORP props: vorpMetrics?: Map<string, PlayerVorpMetrics>, needWeightEnabled?: boolean, needAlpha?: number, posNeeds?: Record<string, number>
   - Validate suggested picks sorting and localStorage persistence keys:
     - suggested.sortField, suggested.sortDir
   - Confirm recommendation fields cover: rank, name, pos, projFp, vorp, vbd, adp, avail, fit
   - Acceptance:
     - No TypeScript errors.
     - Sorting/persistence works across reloads.
     - No API changes required upstream.

Nice-to-have (only if time remains)
- Persist team name edits to backend or app state (wire through existing edit flow).
- Add unit tests for heatmap scaling and MyRoster sorting persistence (web/__tests__/).

Constraints
- Maintain TypeScript strictness and existing patterns.
- Keep CSS Modules scoping intact.
- Avoid regressions in layout/alignment.
- Keep changes focused to the files listed; do not refactor unrelated modules.

Paths to inspect and modify
- web/components/DraftDashboard/DraftBoard.module.scss (team label widths)
- web/components/DraftDashboard/DraftBoard.tsx (heatmap intensity logic)
- web/components/DraftDashboard/MyRoster.tsx (QA and minor fixes)
- web/styles/vars.scss (add $team-label-width)

Acceptance checklist
- Builds and typechecks cleanly.
- UI alignment unchanged for team labels after tokenization.
- Heatmap intensity behaves more consistently early in drafts.
- MyRoster recommendations sort and persist settings correctly.

Please:
- Identify exact selectors/usages for team label width and replace with the new token.
- Implement the heatmap max detection with safe fallbacks.
- Audit MyRoster props and sorting/persistence with minimal code changes.
- Summarize the changes and any follow-ups needed.
