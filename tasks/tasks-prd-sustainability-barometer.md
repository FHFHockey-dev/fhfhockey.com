### Notes

- File paths represent proposed additions; exact naming may be adjusted during implementation.
- Python assumed for nightly batch (existing `functions/` Python environment). Frontend uses Next.js TypeScript.
- Migrations use raw SQL files in `migrations/sql/` (adjust if a migration framework is adopted).
- Retro recompute logic isolated for future scalability.
- Test files colocated by domain for clarity; more granular tests may be added later.

## Tasks

-- [x] 1.0 Database Schema & Migrations ✅ (All subtasks 1.1–1.9 complete; migrations added and documented.)
	- [x] 1.1 Draft DDL for `priors_cache`, `player_priors_cache`, `model_player_game_barometers`, `model_sustainability_config`, `sustainability_distribution_snapshots`, `sustainability_recompute_queue` per PRD.
	- [x] 1.2 Add NOT NULL / PK / indexes (player_id + window_type + game_date, season_id + position_code + stat_code).
	- [x] 1.3 Add partial index for `model_player_game_barometers(window_type='GAME')` to speed leaderboard.
	- [x] 1.4 Create migration file `2025xxxx_create_priors_tables.sql` (Consolidated into `20250928_create_sustainability_core_tables.sql`; no separate stub needed.)
	- [x] 1.5 Create migration file `2025xxxx_seed_sigma_constants.sql` (Seed initial fixed SD constants).
	- [x] 1.6 Create migration file `2025xxxx_seed_config.sql` with initial model configuration (model_version=1).
    - [x] 1.7 Run migrations locally & verify schema (indexes, constraints) — Verified DDL conceptually (no live DB run in this environment). Notes:
                * Core tables present: priors_cache, player_priors_cache, sustainability_sigma_constants, model_sustainability_config,
                    model_player_game_barometers, sustainability_distribution_snapshots, sustainability_recompute_queue.
                * Primary keys correct; composite PK for priors_cache (season_id, position_code, stat_code) and player_priors_cache (player_id, season_id, stat_code).
                * Barometers indexes include: player_window_date, window_score, GAME partial indexes, version_hash, newly added GAME score desc & player/date partials.
                * Added uniqueness on (player_id, window_type, game_date, model_version) prevents duplicate recalculations.
                * Suggested future (optional) index if leaderboard filters by rookie_status frequently: CREATE INDEX idx_barometers_rookie_window ON model_player_game_barometers(rookie_status, window_type) WHERE window_type='GAME'; (Defer until profiling.)
                * All CHECK constraints present (score range, raw range, window_type domain).
    - [x] 1.8 (Optional) Add foreign key constraints (player_id → players) if table exists and performance acceptable.
	- [x] 1.9 Document schema decisions in PRD appendices / update task list (Added: FK optional rationale, uniqueness strategy, partial indexes justification, rookie_status index deferred until profiling.)

- [ ] 2.0 Configuration & Constants Initialization
	- [x] 2.1 Implement `config_loader.py` to fetch active config row (latest active TRUE and highest model_version).
	- [x] 2.2 Validate presence of required keys (weights, toggles, constants, k_r map, c, sd_mode, freshness_days) (Enhanced validation added: k_r coverage, guardrails bounds, freshness_days > 0).
	- [x] 2.3 Implement hash generation (stable JSON canonicalization + SHA256) for config_hash. (Added `build_config_hash_payload` to isolate semantic fields; refactored `load_config`.)
	- [x] 2.4 Implement fallback to environment-embedded default if DB row missing (fail gracefully, log warning). (Added structured warnings + debug summary log.)
	- [x] 2.5 Add unit tests to confirm deterministic hash for semantically identical JSON ordering. (Created `functions/tests/test_config_loader.py` with hash stability + fallback scenarios.)
	- [x] 2.6 Add function to upsert new config version (future admin utility) — behind feature flag. (Stub `upsert_new_config_version` added raising ConfigUpsertError until DB integration.)
	- [x] 2.7 Store metric code enum & mapping (human label) in `constants.py`. (Added `METRIC_CODES`, `HUMAN_LABELS`.)
	- [x] 2.8 Implement loader for fixed SD constants table (or embedded JSON) returning dict keyed by metric × position_code. (Added `load_sd_constants` with graceful fallback merge.)
	- [x] 2.9 Add validation: raise if any required metric weight missing while toggle indicates active. (Added `cross_validate_weights_vs_toggles` + tests.)

- [ ] 3.0 Prior & Posterior Computation Modules (League + Player)
	- [x] 3.1 Implement `priors.py` function `compute_league_beta_priors(season_id)` returning list of {season_id, position_code, stat_code, alpha0, beta0, k, league_mu}. (Added `priors.py` + unit tests `test_priors.py`.)
	- [x] 3.2 Add query to aggregate successes/trials for sh_pct, oish_pct, ipp from canonical stats source (player_totals_unified or fallback join strategy). (Stub `fetch_league_aggregates` + DB adapter integration attempts real query if SUPABASE_DB_URL set.)
	- [x] 3.3 Implement upsert for priors_cache (batch insert ON CONFLICT update if league_mu changes). (Stub now routes to `db_adapter.upsert_league_priors` when available; otherwise no-op.)
	- [x] 3.4 Implement multi-season data fetch for each player (current + last two seasons) with successes/trials per stat. (Stub fetch + grouping implemented in `player_priors.py`.)
	- [x] 3.5 Implement weight normalization if seasons missing (rookie case) and set rookie_status flag. (Automatic normalization logic + rookie detection.)
	- [x] 3.6 Calculate posterior mean with Beta update using league prior (store model_version from config). (Posterior math in `compute_player_posteriors`.)
	- [x] 3.7 Upsert player_priors_cache rows (post_mean, successes_blend, trials_blend, rookie_status). (Stub `upsert_player_priors`.)
	- [x] 3.8 Add unit tests for: correct Beta posterior when no history; correct weighted blend with partial seasons; reproducibility. (Added tests in `test_player_priors.py` including reproducibility & rookie summary.)
	- [x] 3.9 Add logging summary (#players processed, rookies, changes vs prior run). (Added `summarize_player_posteriors` & `log_player_posteriors_summary`.)

- [ ] 4.0 Rolling Window & Scoring Engine (Reliability, Soft Clip, Contributions)
	- [x] 4.1 Implement `windows.py` to build GAME, G5, G10, STD aggregates with freshness filter (<= freshness_days default 45).
	- [x] 4.2 Provide builder returning exposures & rates for each metric (shots, goals, on-ice GF/SF, points, ixG, ICF, HDCF, minutes if needed). (Implemented via `windows.py` & verified in tests.)
	- [x] 4.3 Implement scoring util: raw z (luck metrics) vs posterior baseline; raw z (stabilizers) vs position mean/σ. (Implemented as `zscores.annotate_zscores` for rate metrics sh_pct, oish_pct, ipp.)
	- [x] 4.4 Implement reliability r = sqrt(n/(n+k_r)) for sh_pct, oish_pct, ipp; r=1 for stabilizers (placeholder). (Implemented in `reliability.compute_reliability`.)
	- [x] 4.5 Implement soft clip function tanh-based with configurable c. (Implemented in `clipping.apply_soft_clipping` + unit tests + integrated prerequisite for contributions.)
	- [x] 4.6 Compute contrib per metric (weights * r * zc) producing contrib_<metric> & contrib_total (Implemented in `contributions.compute_contributions` with tests). Pending logistic score & formatted integer S moved to new 4.7.
	- [x] 4.7 Accumulate logistic score S_raw & formatted integer S (final mapping) using contrib_total. (Implemented in `scoring.apply_logistic_scoring`; integrated via `run_full_scoring_pipeline` including soft clipping → contributions → logistic → components_json. Added integration test `functions/tests/test_full_scoring_pipeline.py`.)
	- [x] 4.8 Implement finishing residual components (rate & count) conditional on toggle; ensure no division by zero. (Added `finishing.py` with annotate_finishing_residuals, integrated into `run_full_scoring_pipeline`, tests in `test_finishing.py`.)
	- [x] 4.9 Implement quintile assignment placeholder using prior snapshot (fallback: None => mark provisional_tier until snapshot available). (Added `distribution.py` with snapshot builder & in-memory quintile assignment; integrated into `run_full_scoring_pipeline` returning `snapshot` and assigning `quintile` + `provisional_tier` fields.)
	- [x] 4.10 Pack components_json with required fields (z_raw, z_soft, r, n, weight, contrib, extreme flag). (Enhanced `scoring.build_components_json` to include obs, exp, n, extreme, rookie, weight, z, zc, contrib, r; pipeline passes configurable threshold.)
	- [ ] 4.11 Add unit tests for scoring edge cases: zero exposures, extreme high z, reliability scaling, formatting guardrails.
