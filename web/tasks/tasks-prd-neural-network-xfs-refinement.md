### Notes

- Unit tests should be placed alongside the code files they are testing
- Use `npm test [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests with Vitest
- The existing neural network file will be significantly enhanced rather than replaced
- All ML utilities should follow consistent interfaces for easy integration
- Feature engineering pipeline should be modular to allow easy addition of new features
