# PRD: Neural Network xFS Refinement System

## Introduction/Overview

This PRD outlines the comprehensive refinement of the existing xFS (Expected Fantasy Score) neural network prediction system to achieve near-100% accuracy through advanced feature engineering, sophisticated rating systems, and real-time data integration. The current system uses basic arithmetic calculations; this project will transform it into a state-of-the-art machine learning system that analyzes 100+ features across player performance, team dynamics, opponent strength, and contextual factors.

**Problem Statement:** The current xFS prediction system is overly simplistic, using only 3 variables (points, shots, TOI) with fixed weights. This lacks the sophistication needed for accurate fantasy hockey predictions, missing critical factors like opponent strength, linemate chemistry, goalie performance, and contextual variables.

**Goal:** Build a neural network system that achieves the highest possible prediction accuracy by identifying and modeling the most common indicators of fantasy productivity with optimal pattern recognition for predictability.

## Goals

1. **Achieve Maximum Prediction Accuracy:** Strive for as close to 100% accuracy as possible through comprehensive data analysis and pattern recognition
2. **Implement Comprehensive Rating Systems:** Create detailed player, team, and goalie rating systems for context-aware predictions
3. **Advanced Linemate Integration:** Build sophisticated linemate chemistry analysis with real-time line combination tracking
4. **Real-time Model Updates:** Develop ensemble methods with continuous learning capabilities
5. **Feature Engineering Excellence:** Extract 100+ meaningful features from existing database tables to identify the strongest predictors of fantasy performance

## User Stories

1. **As a fantasy hockey analyst**, I want the xFS system to predict player performance with maximum accuracy so that I can make optimal lineup decisions with confidence.

2. **As a data scientist**, I want comprehensive feature importance analysis so that I can understand which factors most strongly predict fantasy success.

3. **As a developer**, I want modular rating systems (player, team, goalie) so that I can easily update and maintain different components independently.

4. **As a product manager**, I want real-time model performance monitoring so that I can track accuracy improvements and identify areas needing refinement.

5. **As an end user**, I want predictions that account for lineup changes, injuries, and matchup-specific factors so that my daily fantasy decisions are based on the most relevant information.

## Open Questions

1. **Historical Training Data:** How many seasons of historical data should be used for initial model training to balance recency with sample size?

2. **Injury Data Integration:** What level of injury detail should be incorporated, and how should injury probability be modeled?

3. **Lineup Change Timing:** How should the system handle lineup changes that occur after predictions are generated but before games start?

4. **Model Ensemble Weighting:** Should ensemble model weights be static or dynamically adjusted based on recent performance?

5. **Feature Engineering Automation:** Should the system automatically discover new feature combinations, or should they be manually engineered?

6. **Cross-Position Modeling:** Should separate models be trained for each position, or should position be treated as a feature in a unified model?

7. **Prediction Confidence Thresholds:** At what confidence level should the system decline to make a prediction due to insufficient data?

8. **Real-time Data Dependencies:** Which data sources are critical enough to delay predictions if unavailable, versus which can use last-known values?
